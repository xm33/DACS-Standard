## Chapter 12 — Unified threat model

This chapter collects, partitions, and rationalises the per-chapter security considerations into a unified threat model. It is the artifact a security review would start from. Where this chapter restates per-chapter threats, the per-chapter mitigation is normative; this chapter’s framing is informative.

### 12.1 Scope and non-goals

DACS’s security goals are:

- (a) cryptographic non-repudiation of every per-session artifact (listings, bundles, agreements, evidence) by the parties that produced them;
- (b) tamper-evident audit trail — any modification of an anchored artifact is detectable by content-hash comparison;
- (c) limited-trust substrate dependency — the substrate is trusted for liveness and consensus per its own security model, not for application-layer semantics;
- (d) prevention of cross-protocol signature confusion via the universal domain-separation scheme in §B.7;
- (e) prevention of replay across sessions via per-session jobIds, nonces, and content hashes;
- (f) substrate-failure isolation in reputation derivation so substrate outages do not damage party reputations.

Non-goals:

- DACS does **not** prevent collusion between buyer and seller. Two parties who jointly fabricate a session produce a valid session; the audit trail records what they say happened, not what objectively happened.
- DACS does **not** prevent denial-of-service by a counterparty or by the substrate. It produces evidence of the failure for reputation purposes, but does not guarantee progress.
- DACS does **not** prevent regulatory non-compliance. It produces artifacts useful for compliance audit but does not enforce any specific regulatory regime.
- DACS does **not** provide unconditional privacy. The SR-4 channel contents stay between members, but member identity and timing of commitments are visible on the public chain by design.

**The visibility non-goal extends to the audit layer.** Anchored DACS-5 bundles, commit-agreement records, and DACS-2 vet attestations carry party **primary claims — durable authority-issued identities (LEI, FINRA-CRD, …) — in cleartext at derivable addresses**. A passive observer can therefore reconstruct the **counterparty graph** (who transacted with whom, correlatable across every session an identity runs) with **no cryptography to break**, and can read each vet attestation's `scheme:identifier:decision` (e.g. "party X was screened against OFAC → clear"). DACS accepts this by design — it is an *accountability* standard, and a public, verifiable audit trail necessarily exposes the relationship. Raw private *values* behind a verification are separately protected by the §7.5 public-anchor data-minimisation rule; only predicate outcomes are exposed.

> **Note (non-normative).** A confidentiality layer that anchors these records **encrypted to the parties** while keeping the content hash public for tamper-evidence is roadmap work, not v0.1.

### 12.2 Adversary model

The threat model assumes adversaries with the following capabilities; per-threat mitigations specify which class is being defended against.

| Adversary class | Capabilities | Assumed not capable of |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Network observer | Reads all public-chain traffic; can perform timing analysis on commitments; **can reconstruct the counterparty graph from anchored bundles / commit-agreement records / vet attestations (cleartext primary claims at derivable addresses) and read each vet attestation's scheme:identifier:decision**; cannot read private-channel contents. | Breaking standard cryptographic primitives (sha256, Ed25519, ECDSA-secp256k1 under standard assumptions); recovering the raw private values behind a verification (predicate-outcome-only under §7.5 minimisation). |
| Network active attacker | Can drop, delay, reorder, or inject messages on transport links; can MITM TLS sessions if PKI is compromised. | Forging signatures by valid private keys; producing sha256 preimages. |
| Malicious counterparty | Operates a fully-conformant DACS implementation but maximises self-interest within the protocol; signs everything they’re willing to be held to and refuses to sign anything else. | Forging the other party’s signatures; controlling validator-set consensus on the substrate. |
| Compromised authority | A registry authority (GLEIF, FINRA, OFAC, etc.) returns false data, either by deliberate compromise or by API corruption. | Forging substrate-validator signatures over the false response (validators sign the fetch result, not the data’s factuality). |
| Substrate validator-set minority | A minority of substrate validators is compromised; the consensus protocol’s normal Byzantine bound holds. | Producing valid consensus signatures on falsehoods (assuming the BFT assumption holds). |
| Substrate validator-set majority | A majority of substrate validators is compromised. | (none — above the substrate’s security floor; DACS inherits the failure.) |
| Substrate operator (rotating shard) | For Liquidity Tank-style SR-5: the rotating validator shard operating tanks is partially compromised within its multisig threshold. | Bypassing the 2/3 BFT multisig or the deployer emergency-recovery path. |
| Channel operator (SR-4) | Operates the private negotiation channel; can drop messages, fork views, observe all member messages. | Forging member signatures inside the channel; observing messages encrypted to a member subset (with realisation-appropriate encryption). |
| Recipe-registry attacker | Compromises the recipe registry signing key, attempts to push poisoned recipes. | Backdating recipe-version pinning; affecting already-pinned sessions. |
| Sybil attacker | Generates unlimited low-tier (key:…) identities and farms self-deal reputation. | Generating authority-issued claims (lei, finra-crd, etc.) without owning the underlying registrations. |
| Malicious orchestrator | Drives the session pipeline, assigns `errorClass`, constructs the SessionRecord, and MAY be a distinct REQUIRED signer (§10.4.1); can misclassify failures, drop or reorder phase results, or selectively anchor. | Forging buyer/seller signatures, or producing a both-sided-signed bundle without honest-party consent (§10.11 two-sided independent bundles; party-disagreement → aborted-by-other). |
| Malicious infrastructure | Operates discovery/index/storage infrastructure a party depends on (catalog API, listings index, anchor host); can serve poisoned, stale, or withheld data on the read path. | Forging the signatures on the signed artifacts it serves (consumers dereference anchors and verify content hashes + signatures independently). |
| Malicious verifier | Runs the DACS-2 vet path; can mis-run a recipe, substitute a method, or assert a decision the authority did not return. | Forging the authority's signed/consensus-anchored response, or a recipe steward signature; producing a VerifyResult that re-derives correctly under method/recipe-version checks. |
| Spam / resource-exhaustion adversary | Floods a public surface (ERC-8004 registry writes, negotiation-channel griefing, mempool) to raise cost or degrade availability. | Forging identities or claims (each write/identity costs); breaking liveness of correctly-rate-limited or staked surfaces. |

**Reconciling the §12.4 "Primary adversary" column with this model.** Every §12.4 row's adversary resolves to a class above, with two conventions:

- (a) **Variants of an existing class** — "competing bidder" and "two colluding counterparties" are *Malicious counterparty* (single and colluding); "public-mempool observer" is *Network observer*; "storage operator" is *Malicious infrastructure*.
- (b) **Non-adversary conditions** — "time" (TOCTOU / stale-window races) and "implementation bug" (e.g. decimal overflow) are **environmental / robustness** conditions, not adversaries. The threat is real and the cited mitigation stands, but there is no actor to model; these rows are defended by deterministic rules and bounds, not by an adversary assumption.

### 12.3 Trust boundaries

A reader following the audit trail from a DACS-5 bundle backwards through the lifecycle crosses these trust boundaries; each boundary has its own assumptions.

- **Party-to-party cryptographic boundary.** Every signed artifact (listing, bundle, agreement, evidence, rating) is verifiable against the signer’s primary-claim key. Trust assumption: the signing key has not been compromised at or before the artifact’s timestamp. Mitigation: key-rotation handling per §6.6 (DACS-1 security considerations).
- **Party-to-authority boundary.** A DACS-2 VerifyResult of method consensus-backed-proxy depends on the authority (GLEIF, FINRA, OFAC, etc.) being honest at fetch time and on the TLS PKI between the substrate validators and the authority. Mitigation: the recipe’s alternatives mechanism (§7.4) lets high-stakes schemes declare additional independent verification methods (§7.12); the v0.2 strengthening (§7.3.5) will tighten the consensus-backed-proxy method itself.
- **Party-to-substrate boundary.** Every anchor (listings, bundles, evidence, recipes, rails) depends on the substrate’s SR-2 implementation for availability and content integrity. Trust assumption: substrate validator-set is honest per the substrate’s consensus protocol. Mitigation: on-substrate anchoring (Storage Programs on Demos) provides indefinite availability; off-substrate anchoring (IPFS, HTTPS) is best-effort.
- **Substrate-to-substrate boundary (cross-chain).** SR-5 atomic settlement crosses chains and depends on the SR-5 mechanism’s trust model (HTLC: cryptographic only; Liquidity Tank: substrate operator; substrate-native: substrate consensus). Mitigation: explicit rail-trust-model disclosure in rail definitions; per-stake rail selection.
- **Party-to-recipe-registry boundary.** Verification routes through recipes whose signing authority is the registry steward (currently KyneSys Labs, per §7.4.4 and §11.1.1). Trust assumption: the steward’s signing key is honest and uncompromised. Mitigation: monotonic recipe-version pinning per session; emergency-revision discipline (§7.4.4). Residual risk under PA-2: steward-key compromise; PA-3 multi-signature governance is the v0.2+ mitigation pathway.

### 12.4 Threat catalogue

### 12.5 Composite trust property

A DACS-5 bundle that validates against all per-chapter conformance rules and whose contained references all dereference and validate provides the following composite trust property to a consumer:

> "Two or more parties identified by the named primary claims (with the trust profile each claim’s scheme implies) participated in a session against the named listing version, agreed to the named terms, exchanged the named settlements, and produced this audit record. The substrate operator did not collude with the parties to forge the record. The recipe registry was not compromised at the time of the verifications. The composed external standards (W3C VC, TLSNotary, ACME, etc.) behaved per their own security models."

This is the composite security claim of DACS v0.1. Each clause has explicit mitigation in the per-chapter sections; each has explicit residual risk in this chapter’s adversary model.
