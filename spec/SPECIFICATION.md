# DACS — Demos Agent Commerce Standards

**Introduction and DACS-1 through DACS-5**

> Published as DACS **v0.1** — the first publicly released version. See [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) for normative change history.

## About this document

This document specifies DACS — the Demos Agent Commerce Standards — across five per-stage standards: DACS-1 (Identify), DACS-2 (Vet), DACS-3 (Negotiate), DACS-4 (Settle), and DACS-5 (Verify). Shared material (terminology, substrate capabilities, the Demos production mapping, references) is presented once in the front and back matter rather than repeated per chapter. Each per-stage chapter contains the material specific to that stage. The companion DACS Dev Tasks working document is published separately and is **not** part of the standards.
**Normative language.** This document uses the RFC 2119 / RFC 8174 keywords **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL**, interpreted as in those RFCs. Keywords are normative only when in uppercase.
**Versioning.** This document is **DACS v0.1**, the first publicly released version. Earlier drafts circulated internally under per-stage version numbers (DACS-1..5 v0.1, paper v0.7) and a brief v0.8 cut that consolidated review-pass revisions; those numbers are retired and reset to a common baseline. v0.1 is that baseline: all five per-stage standards plus the front-matter substrate-binding, the threat model, the glossary, and the conformance plan are published together at v0.1. From this baseline onward, each per-stage standard versions independently — a standard that gains capabilities bumps its own minor version (v0.2, v0.3, …) without forcing the others — through to v1.0, the version at which a standard is considered ready for unsupervised production use.

## Abstract

Autonomous agents are transacting with agents they have never met. Open standards exist for fragments of what a transaction requires — identity registries, payment authorisation, HTTP-layer micropayments, capability discovery — but each addresses one slice of the problem. Nothing in widespread use composes the fragments into a working commerce lifecycle, which is why agents that need the full lifecycle today fall back to closed operator marketplaces.
**DACS — Demos Agent Commerce Standards** — is the protocol Demos uses for agent commerce. It is organised around the five stages every agent-to-agent transaction passes through: **Identify, Vet, Negotiate, Settle, Verify.** For each stage, DACS composes with the existing standards that already work and adds new standards where the open ecosystem has gaps. Each new standard names the substrate capability it depends on. DACS is built for the Demos Network, but the capability-level specification is kept clean of Demos-specific dependencies so a substrate that provides the same capabilities can host a compatible implementation.

## 1. The problem

An agent making a transaction with another agent today has three working options:

- **Pre-integrated bilateral trust.** Two operators agree in advance what counts as identity, payment, and delivery. Works for small ecosystems, breaks at scale.
- **Closed operator marketplace.** Both agents onboard to a platform that handles identity, payment, and dispute. Works at scale, but the operator captures rents, controls access, and becomes a single point of trust.
- **Open standards.** Identity, payment, discovery via published standards any agent can implement. The only path that scales without conceding a marketplace position to an operator, but only if a complete lifecycle exists. The open standards available today cover stages, not the lifecycle.

The fragments exist. The lifecycle does not. A buyer agent today can use existing open standards to discover that a seller agent exists, recognise the seller’s identity, and authorise a payment to it. What it cannot do with open standards alone:

- Declare what bundle of identity claims a transaction requires — from a signing key for a micropayment to LEI plus regulatory registration plus sanctions clearance for an institutional trade — and verify each claim against the right authority.
- Negotiate terms in private. Sealed-bid procurement, RFQ across counterparties, and term negotiation on flows touching material non-public information all need to happen without leaking to a public mempool or requiring a trusted execution environment.
- Produce an end-to-end session record anchoring identity, verification, negotiation, payment, delivery, and attestation into a single audit artifact the participants own.

These gaps map cleanly to four of the five stages of a transaction. They are why institutional and regulated agents still fall back to operator marketplaces. DACS is designed to provide the lifecycle on a public, permissionless substrate, composing with the open standards that already work for individual stages while filling the gaps that remain.
**Why this matters now.** Agent commerce is moving from prototype to production. Google’s AP2, donated to the FIDO Alliance in April 2026, is establishing the payment-mandate envelope. Coinbase’s x402 is settling per-request micropayments. ERC-8004 is formalising on-chain agent identity in the Ethereum Foundation pipeline. ERC-8183 adds an EVM-native escrow primitive for job-style transactions. A2A is becoming the default capability discovery pattern. Each is real, deployed, and useful. Each addresses one slice. None of them, individually or together, specifies a complete commerce lifecycle with the discipline a regulated flow requires.
Meanwhile the closed alternatives are consolidating fast: full-stack agent platforms are building their own identity, payment, reputation, and dispute systems behind operator-owned APIs. If a usable lifecycle does not emerge from the public-chain ecosystem soon, the agent economy ends up looking like the app stores, with two or three platforms collecting rents on everything that moves. DACS is the Demos contribution to keeping the lifecycle on public infrastructure.

## 2. The approach

DACS follows three principles.
**Composition.** Identity, payment, and several forms of credential attestation already have working standards with real adoption. There is no value in replacing them, and reinventing them slows everyone down. DACS uses composition, not replacement.
**Gap-filling.** Where there are real gaps, DACS specifies a new standard. New standards stay narrow in scope and are designed to compose cleanly with the rest of the stack.
**Stated substrate requirements.** Each new DACS standard names the substrate capability it depends on. The capability is the requirement, stated in the spec. Which substrate provides it is operational detail. This keeps DACS substrate-agnostic in specification while staying honest about what the new standards actually need underneath.
Three things follow:

- **Adopters keep what they already have.** A seller using existing identity, payment, and credential tooling does not abandon any of it to adopt DACS.
- **DACS is replaceable in parts.** If a better identity standard supersedes a pre-existing standard, the DACS standard referencing identity updates its pointers and the rest of the stack is unaffected.
- **DACS is substrate-portable in principle.** The substrate requirements are explicit. Any substrate that implements them can host a DACS implementation.

## 3. The five stages

Every agent-to-agent transaction, whether a $5 data lookup or a $5M institutional swap, passes through five stages:

- **Identify** — who is transacting, what is being offered, and how do they find each other.
- **Vet** — each party verifies the other’s claims against authoritative sources.
- **Negotiate** — parties arrive at agreed terms (price, scope, deadlines, deliverable spec) and commit to them.
- **Settle** — value is exchanged and the deliverable is provided.
- **Verify** — the complete transaction is anchored as an audit artifact; reputation is derived from it.

DACS is one standard per stage. Each standard either fully composes existing open standards for that stage, or specifies what is needed to close the gaps. Phase types specific to a stage (e.g. negotiate-rfq, pay-cross-chain-htlc) belong to that stage’s standard.

| Standard | Stage | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DACS-1 | Identify | Agent identity, signed and anchored service listings, discovery (.well-known/agent.json extension and off-chain catalog) |
| DACS-2 | Vet | Method-pluggable credential attestation against authoritative sources |
| DACS-3 | Negotiate | Private negotiation phases (RFQ, sealed envelope, fixed price), agreement commitment |
| DACS-4 | Settle | Payment rail registry, payment phases, delivery phases |
| DACS-5 | Verify | Session record, attestation bundle, reputation derivation |

The stages are sequential within a transaction. The standards are published together at the v0.1 baseline and version independently thereafter. Chapters 6–10 below specify them in detail.

## 4. Per-stage summary

A compact summary of what each stage composes, what it adds, and which substrate capabilities it depends on. Chapters 6–10 expand each row in full.

| Stage | Existing standards used | DACS additions | Substrate capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Identify (DACS-1) | ERC-8004, W3C DIDs, A2A, authority and platform identifiers | Identity claim reference scheme; identity bundle schema; listing schema; .well-known extension; catalog API | SR-2; SR-1 optional |
| Vet (DACS-2) | W3C VC, TLSNotary, zkTLS | Method-pluggable recipe registry; proxy-attestation method for public-registry credentials; composite verification record | SR-2, SR-3 |
| Negotiate (DACS-3) | (none widely adopted) | Private negotiation phases; agreement commitment | SR-4 (private patterns), SR-2 |
| Settle (DACS-4) | AP2, x402, ERC-20, SPL, HTLC | Payment rail registry; payment and delivery phases (incl. Liquidity Tanks) | SR-2, SR-5 (cross-chain only) |
| Verify (DACS-5) | ERC-8004 reputation registry (publication surface) | Session record; attestation bundle; reputation derivation | SR-1, SR-2 |

Three stages compose substantially with existing standards (Identify, Vet, Settle). Two stages are gap-filled almost entirely (Negotiate, Verify). All five reference the same small set of substrate capabilities introduced in chapter 5.

## 5. Substrate capabilities

Every DACS standard names the substrate capability it depends on. The capabilities below are the complete set; each per-stage chapter cites a subset by ID.

| ID | Capability | Description | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SR-1 | Cross-substrate identity aggregation | Optional. A composition primitive binding one root key to multiple sub-identities — per-substrate keys, verified Web2 identifiers, authority-issued identifiers, platform accounts — presented under a single signature. Cross-Context Identities (CCI) is the Demos implementation. | DACS-1, DACS-5 |
| SR-2 | Anchored, immutable storage | Content-addressed key-value storage with chain-anchored writes, suitable for signed documents up to a soft size limit. Storage Programs is the Demos implementation. | DACS-1, 2, 3, 4, 5 |
| SR-3 | Consensus-backed proxy attestation of HTTP responses | A substrate primitive that, given a fetch specification, returns a response signed by a consensus set of validators and anchors the attestation on chain at production throughput. DAHR (Data Agnostic HTTPS Relay) is the Demos implementation. | DACS-2 (one of several methods) |
| SR-4 | Identity-keyed private coordination channels | Private channels whose membership is bound to the substrate’s public-chain identity and whose contents stay between members. The public chain sees only commitments. L2PS (Layer-2 Privacy Subnets) is the Demos implementation. | DACS-3 (private negotiation patterns) |
| SR-5 | Multi-chain coordinated atomic settlement | Atomic settlement across substrates. May be provided by substrate-native cross-chain transactions, HTLC contracts on participating chains, or pre-funded liquidity primitives such as Liquidity Tanks on Demos. | DACS-4 (cross-chain settlement only) |

A substrate shipping all five can host a full DACS implementation. A substrate that ships some subset can host DACS partially: listings whose pipelines require unsupported capabilities are unfulfillable there, but the rest of the stack still works.
**Substrate-coupling status in v0.1.** SR-1, SR-2, and SR-5 are specified at the protocol level: another substrate that ships an equivalent primitive (cross-substrate identity aggregation; content-addressed anchored storage; atomic cross-chain settlement) can interoperate with DACS implementations on Demos at the artifact level (the bundles, listings, evidence records validate the same way). **SR-3 and SR-4 are specified at the trust-property level only in v0.1.** Two substrates each shipping their own SR-3 (consensus-backed proxy attestation) or SR-4 (identity-keyed private coordination) implementations will *not* be wire-protocol interoperable; the trust properties listed under CH-1..CH-6 for SR-4 and under §7.3.5 for SR-3 are the conformance bar v0.1 requires, but the underlying message formats and consensus signatures are substrate-specific. v2 of DACS-2 and DACS-3 is expected to specify wire formats for SR-3 attestation envelopes and SR-4 channel messages that enable cross-substrate interoperability; until then, a session begun on substrate A cannot be completed on substrate B if it uses any SR-3- or SR-4-dependent phase.
**Reference substrate.** The **Demos Network** is the substrate against which DACS was designed and, as of this draft, the only substrate that ships all five capabilities natively. The DACS specifications cite the substrate capabilities (SR-1 through SR-5), not the Demos primitives themselves; this separation keeps the artifact-level specification portable while staying honest about which primitives are concretely realised today and where v2 work is needed.

## 6. Demos production mapping

A mapping of which substrate primitives are live today, what extensions are needed for v0.1, and which dependencies are third-party. The mapping applies to every per-stage standard — DACS-1 through DACS-5 — in this paper.
**Legend.** 🟢 in production today; 🟡 Demos team to add for v0.1; 🔵 third-party (composed, not built by Demos). This legend describes the substrate-primitive status — what the chain ships. Per-recipe and per-rail operational status uses the normative availability field defined in §7.4.5 (recipes) and §9.4.4 (rails). The legend here is informative about substrate features; availability there is normative about specific attestation paths and settlement rails. Earlier drafts conflated the two surfaces by extending this legend to recipes and rails; that conflation has been corrected in v0.1.

### 6.1 SR-1 — Cross-Context Identities (CCI)

- 🟢 8 native contexts in production: xm, web2, pqc, ud, nomis, humanpassport, ethos, tlsn. Stored in GCRMain.identities. SDK methods getXmIdentities, getWeb2Identities, addXmIdentity, addTwitterIdentity, etc. SIWD (wallet_signIn, EIP-4361-style) for presentation.
- 🟡 6 new CCI contexts for regulatory identity: lei, finra-crd, sam-uei, fedramp, naics, cmmc. Each needs a GCR routine following the pattern of the existing 8 reference implementations.
- 🔵 ERC-8004 token references; W3C DIDs (carried via claim references; verified through DACS-2).

**Stor-backed credentials.** The stor-cred:<type>:<id> scheme convention is the extensibility surface for future credentials not yet promoted to native CCI contexts. **OFAC-clear is not a CCI context** — it is a per-session freshness check that lives only in DACS-2’s CompositeVerificationRecord (it is a check, not a stable identity claim).

### 6.2 SR-2 — Storage Programs

- 🟢 StorageProgramData per SDK at kynesyslabs/sdks/src/storage/StorageProgram.ts. Content-addressed at stor-{sha256(…)}. 128 KB cap. JSONB-backed in GCR_Main.data. ACL modes (private/public/restricted). Provenance via createdByTx, lastModifiedByTx, interactionTxs.
- 🟡 Native multi-party Storage Program signature helper so buyer + seller co-signature of a closed AttestationBundle is a single transaction — current SDK supports owner-signed writes only.

**Logical vs native addresses (applies universally).** Throughout this document, addresses of the form dacs1:…, dacs2:…, dacs3:…, dacs4:…, dacs5:… are *logical* addresses: substrate-independent, human-readable, stable identifiers the protocol reasons about. Variable segments embedded in a logical address (e.g. the seller's primary claim, which itself contains colons) are delimiter-encoded per rule CF-4 (§6.3.4) so the logical string is unambiguously parseable back into its components on any substrate. Each substrate maps the logical address to its native addressing in one of two ways:

- **Pure mapping.** Where a substrate's native address is a pure function of the logical address, the mapping MUST be deterministic, one-to-one, and reversible, and consumers compute the native address directly from the logical pattern before reading.
- **Write-input mapping.** Where a substrate folds write-time inputs (deployer address, transaction nonce, salt) into its native address — as Demos's StorageProgram derivation does (§6.3.4) — the native address is **not** recomputable from the logical address alone. The implementation MUST then publish the logical→native binding: as descriptive metadata on the anchored record AND via the discovery surfaces (§6.3.5 well-known index, §6.3.6 catalog). Consumers resolve the native address through that published binding before reading.

In both cases implementations MUST anchor at the native address, the anchor transaction is the canonical pointer, and consumers MUST verify the content hash after dereferencing.

### 6.3 SR-3 — DAHR (Data Agnostic HTTPS Relay)

- 🟢 Live via demos.web2.createDahr() → dahr.startProxy(…). Returns IWeb2Result with responseHash, responseHeadersHash, txHash. One on-chain web2Request tx per call. GCR routines per CCI context handle native-claim validation (including tlsn).
- 🟡 DAHR signing-model clarification — current docs show **hash commitments only**, with no validator signature over the response body. v0.1 treats this as a **consensus-anchored hash commitment** model. If Kynesys upgrades DAHR to validator-sign the response body itself, DACS-2 v0.2 may strengthen the claim.
- 🟡 CompositeVerificationRecord Storage Program schema.
- 🟡 oauth-attested method depends on a Demos-side OAuth attester. If not built, the method is 🔵 third-party.
- 🔵 W3C Verifiable Credentials, TLSNotary (external proof library — distinct from the 🟢 cci-tlsn:* native context), zkTLS (Reclaim, Pluto), ACME challenges for domain-tls-control.

### 6.4 SR-4 — L2PS (Layer-2 Privacy Subnets)

- 🟢 new l2ps.L2PS() / new l2ps.L2PS(rsaPrivateKey). DemosWork orchestration with WorkStep (id, context, content, output, depends_on, critical), BaseOperation, ConditionalOperation (SDK module @kynesyslabs/demosdk/demoswork). Storage Programs for agreement-hash anchoring and sealed-envelope commitments.
- 🟡 CCI-keyed L2PS membership — bind subnet membership to CCI primary claim so channel signatures map to the same identity that holds value on-chain. Current API is RSA-key-based.
- 🟡 L2PS channel message envelope API — sequence numbering, signature export, transcript export.
- 🟡 Encrypted transcript anchoring helper (for terms.transcriptDisclosurePolicy: "encrypted-anchored-required").
- 🔵 ERC-8183 escrow primitive (Ethereum, draft); institutional RFQ desks’ off-chain systems composed as L2PS-equivalent transport.

**DACS-3 phase types are realised as DemosWork WorkSteps.** Each negotiation pattern compiles to a sequence of WorkSteps with context: "xm" | "web2" | "native" and DACS-defined content shapes.

### 6.5 SR-5 — Native Bridges / Liquidity Tanks

- 🟢 LiquidityTank.sol (audited; 600+ lines; rotating 2/3 multisig + 15-day emergency recovery) deployed on **ETH Sepolia** (0x7AE3A8B899BE0D9E9de51b81a9912C0CEE128d88) and **Polygon Amoy** (0x57cA16EeE7fbeC69BFD46E4806B5d91e173dd600).
- 🟢 SDK type BridgeOperation at kynesyslabs/sdks/src/bridge/nativeBridgeTypes.ts. RPC handler at kynesyslabs/node/src/libs/network/manageNativeBridge.ts. Tank addresses config at kynesyslabs/node/config/tankAddresses.json. **bridge_id** (16-char hash) is the canonical end-to-end tracking handle.
- 🟢 Trust model: **operated by a rotating Demos validator shard under 2/3 BFT multisig with 15-day deployer emergency recovery.** Not "no operator" — the operator is the substrate itself.
- 🟢 MVP scope: USDC only; EVM-source; unidirectional. Gasless bridge operations (contract reimburses user gas from subsidy pool). BridgeOperation.status lifecycle: "empty" → "pending" → "completed" | "failed". XM SDK single-chain transfers (preparePay, prepareTransfer, prepareTransfers) for non-bridge rails. Storage Programs for deliver-storage-program and entitlement records.
- 🟡 Phase 2: Solana tank programs (treasury Phases 3.3–3.4, SolanaAddressManagement class, vault management).
- 🟡 Phase 3: Bidirectional + cross-chain shard rotation.
- 🟡 Phase 4: Production polish + executeBridgeOperations consensus logic + cross-chain bridge message verification + emergency recovery mechanisms. Additional EVM tank deployments (currently 4 placeholder entries in tankAddresses.json). Mainnet deployments. Non-USDC stablecoin support. Native EntitlementRecord registry (optional; Stor-backed is fine for v0.1).
- 🔵 AP2 (Google → FIDO Alliance, April 2026) — DACS-4 carries as a rail envelope. x402 (Coinbase + Cloudflare + Anthropic) — DACS-4 carries as a rail envelope. Rubic Bridge (third-party DEX aggregator, wrapped by SDK at @kynesyslabs/demosdk/bridge) — alternative cross-chain rail with explicit third-party trust disclosure.
- 🔵 **HTLC contracts (generic atomic-swap pattern)** — pay-cross-chain-htlc is a first-class supported rail in DACS-4 v0.1. **The reference implementation in agent-commerce-demo uses HTLCs today for the fx-rfq cross-chain settlement** (929 LOC: real Solana Anchor program + Base Sepolia EVM HTLC contract; lock/reveal/refund implemented end-to-end). This predates Native Bridges Phase 1 deployment. The reference implementation will migrate to pay-cross-chain-liquidity-tank as Phase 1 stabilises; until then both rails are documented honestly. ERC-20, SPL (standard token interfaces). ERC-8183 escrow (proposed; future rail).

**v0.1 cross-chain settlement scope.** pay-cross-chain-liquidity-tank is supported **only** for the rails currently live in tankAddresses.json (ETH Sepolia, Polygon Amoy; USDC; unidirectional EVM source). All other tank rails in the registry are 🟡 to-add and will unlock as Native Bridges Phase 2–4 ship. pay-cross-chain-htlc is the path the reference implementation runs today; v0.1 keeps both first-class.

## 7. Global terminology

Terms used in more than one per-stage chapter are defined here once. Per-stage chapters define only terms unique to that stage.

### 7.1 Claim references and identity

- **Claim.** A fact a party asserts about itself (e.g., "this agent’s FINRA CRD is 12345").
- **Claim reference.** A typed identifier referring to the external system that authoritatively holds a claim. The reference is of the form <scheme>:<identifier>[?<parameters>]. Grammar and v0.1 registry defined in chapter 6 (DACS-1).
- **ClaimReference (type).** The typed equivalent of a claim reference used in JSON schemas throughout the spec.
- **Primary identity claim.** The claim within a bundle that serves as the canonical identifier of the party for reputation, audit, and addressing purposes. Determined by the presentedBy field of the bundle and the primaryClaimSelector of the requirement.
- **Identity bundle.** An ordered set of claims a party presents about itself, each independently verifiable, plus a presentation signature. Full schema in chapter 6 (DACS-1).

### 7.2 Anchoring and signing

- **Anchored.** Stored on the substrate such that an anchor reference (substrate-native pointer plus content hash) is sufficient for any party with substrate access to retrieve the canonical content and verify integrity. Realized by SR-2.
- **Signed.** Carrying an Ed25519 (or equivalent) signature over the RFC 8785 canonical-JSON serialisation of the document’s signed scope, where the signed scope is all fields except the signature field itself.
- **Canonical form.** RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS) serialisation of the document with the signature(s) field omitted.
- **Content hash.** sha256 hex of the canonical form.
- **Numeric safe-integer constraint.** RFC 8785 JCS defines a canonical serialisation only for JSON numbers within the IEEE-754 double range; integers above 2^53−1 (9,007,199,254,740,991) have no reproducible canonical form. Therefore every JSON number in a signed or content-hashed DACS document MUST lie within the IEEE-754 double safe-integer range. Any quantity that may exceed it (token IDs, uint256 values, large on-chain counters or block numbers) MUST be carried as a decimal string (or, where ABI conventions apply, a `0x`-prefixed hex string) rather than a bare JSON number, so that its canonical form and content hash are reproducible across serializers. Producers MUST NOT emit, and readers SHOULD reject, a signed or content-hashed document containing a JSON number outside this range.
- **Unicode normalisation (rule CF-1).** RFC 8785 JCS performs no Unicode normalisation — it preserves whatever code points are present. Therefore, before computing the canonical form, every JSON string value in a signed or content-hashed DACS document MUST be Unicode-normalised to NFC. Both producers and verifiers MUST apply NFC at this stage, so the canonical form, content hash, and signatures are reproducible across implementations regardless of the input's precomposed/decomposed form. Most DACS string fields are ASCII, for which NFC is a no-op; this rule binds the non-ASCII surface (e.g. `cci-ud`, `cci-web2` usernames, `domain:` identifiers). This lifts the per-field NFC requirement on `Identifier` (§6.3.1) into a single normative pre-hash step covering the whole signed scope.

### 7.3 Verification and evidence

- **Verification reference.** A reference to a DACS-2 VerifyResult that attests a claim against its authority.
- **AttestationRef.** A reference to an anchored attestation: anchor locator + content hash + (optional) signer. Defined in chapter 7 (DACS-2).
- **VerifyResult.** The uniform record produced by every DACS-2 verification method. Defined in chapter 7.
- **VerifyResultRef.** A reference to an anchored VerifyResult: anchor + contentHash + recipeVersion (recipeVersion is load-bearing for staleness checks).
- **Composite verification record.** The anchored document produced by the vet-credentials phase, aggregating freshness checks, supplementary signals, and deal-specific claims. Defined in chapter 7.

### 7.4 Session, pipeline, and phases

- **Listing.** A signed, anchored JSON document conforming to chapter 6; the canonical contract for a transaction.
- **Pipeline.** The ordered sequence of PhaseStep entries declared in a listing.
- **Phase / PhaseStep.** A single unit of work in the pipeline; kind names a closed set defined across DACS-2..5.
- **Session.** A per-transaction lifecycle from Identify through Verify.
- **Session record.** The live state document for an active session. Held off-chain by the orchestrator; the bundle is the on-chain artifact. Defined in chapter 10 (DACS-5).
- **Attestation bundle.** The frozen end-of-session artifact, anchored via SR-2. The audit unit. Defined in chapter 10.
- **Agreement document.** The canonical signed JSON document produced by a negotiation pattern. Defined in chapter 8 (DACS-3).
- **SettlementEvidence.** The uniform record produced by every DACS-4 payment and delivery phase. Defined in chapter 9.

### 7.5 Shared phase-handler types

Every phase handler in the stack consumes a SessionContext and returns a PhaseHandlerResult. The full TypeScript declarations:

```
type SessionContext = {

  jobId: string

  listingRef: { listingId: string; version: number; contentHash: string }

  recipeRegistryVersion: number             // DACS-2 registry pinned at session start

  railRegistryVersion: number               // DACS-4 registry pinned at session start

  parties: SessionParty[]

  priorPhaseOutputs: Record<string, unknown> // accumulated contextDelta from completed phases

  signer: SubstrateSigner                   // substrate-specific signing capability

  startedAt: number                         // unix ms

}

type PhaseHandlerResult = {

  ok: boolean

  reason?: string                           // when !ok

  txRefs?: ChainTxRef[]                     // chain references produced by this invocation

  explorerUrls?: string[]                   // human-readable handles, parallel to txRefs

  contextDelta?: Record<string, unknown>    // merged into SessionRecord.PhaseEntry.contextDelta

  attestationRef?: AttestationRef           // anchored evidence reference

  errorClass?: "permanent" | "transient" | "counterparty" | "substrate" | "settlement-atomicity"

}
```

Conformance: phase handlers MUST accept a SessionContext and return a PhaseHandlerResult. On ok: true the orchestrator merges contextDelta into the corresponding PhaseEntry and records txRefs in the session event log; on ok: false the orchestrator classifies the failure per errorClass and applies the retry policy in chapter 10.

### 7.6 Closed registries — v0.1 scope

The v0.1 set of identity schemes (DACS-1), verification methods (DACS-2), negotiation patterns (DACS-3), payment phases (DACS-4), and delivery phases (DACS-4) are **closed**. New entries are added in subsequent minor versions of the relevant standard via the governance process in chapter 11. Implementations MAY support pre-standard "experimental" entries prefixed x-; these MUST be treated as unknown by conforming readers unless out-of-band agreement exists.

### 7.7 Universal signature scheme — domain-separated signing

Every signature in DACS — across DACS-1 (listings, revocations), DACS-2 (VerifyResults, composite records, recipes), DACS-3 (channel messages, agreements, commitments), DACS-4 (settlement evidence, amendments, rails, entitlements), and DACS-5 (bundles, ratings) — MUST be computed over a domain-separated payload. The domain separator prevents cross-protocol signature replay: a signature produced under one artifact kind MUST NOT validate as a signature under any other artifact kind, even when the underlying hash bytes coincide.
The canonical payload to be signed is:

```
signed_bytes := domain_separator || artifact_hash

domain_separator := "dacs-" || artifact_kind || ":v" || version_tag || ":"

artifact_hash    := the sha256 hex of the RFC 8785 canonical form of the

                    signed document, with the signature field(s) omitted
```

**`version_tag` binding.** `version_tag` is the **major** version of the per-stage standard that defines the artifact kind. All minor versions within a major (v0.1, v0.2, …) share the same `version_tag`; only a major break (v1 → v2) bumps it. The v0.1 registry below therefore uses `:v1:` for every kind and stays frozen across the independent per-stage minor versioning of §11.1.2 — a DACS-2 v0.2 VerifyResult still signs under `dacs-verifyresult:v1:`. (Forward-readability of signed artifacts across a minor bump is what SIG-5 below guarantees.)

The v0.1 registry of domain separators is closed:

| Artifact | Domain separator | Defined in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DACS-1 listing | "dacs-listing:v1:" | §6.3.4 |
| DACS-1 listing revocation marker | "dacs-revocation:v1:" | §6.3.4 |
| DACS-1 identity bundle presentation | "dacs-bundle-presentation:v1:" | §6.3.2 |
| DACS-2 VerifyResult | "dacs-verifyresult:v1:" | §7.5 |
| DACS-2 composite verification record | "dacs-composite:v1:" | §7.7 |
| DACS-2 recipe | "dacs-recipe:v1:" | §7.4 |
| DACS-3 channel message | "dacs-channelmsg:v1:" | §8.3.3 |
| DACS-3 agreement | "dacs-agreement:v1:" | §8.5 |
| DACS-3 commitment record | "dacs-commitment:v1:" | §8.6 |

**Payload shape — single-hash vs composite.** Most artifacts use the single-hash payload `domain_separator || artifact_hash`. Three entries are *composite-payload* separators that, by design, prepend the separator to more than one framed value rather than a single artifact hash: `dacs-session-binding:v1:` (`|| session_key || bundle_hash`, §6.3.2), `dacs-auto-accept-commitment:v1:` (`|| sha256(canonical(commitment))`, single-hash), and `dacs-auto-accept-instance:v1:` (`|| agreementHash || autoAcceptCommitmentHash`, §8.4.1). For composite-payload separators each appended value MUST be a fixed-length hex sha256 digest (or, for `session_key`, the fixed-length hex public key) so the concatenation is unambiguously parseable; this is the sanctioned exception to the single-`artifact_hash` shape and these separators are first-class registry entries, not `dacs-x-` extensions.

**Conformance.** (SIG-1) Every signature in DACS v0.1 MUST be computed over the appropriate domain-separated payload from the table above (single-hash or composite per the note above). (SIG-2) Verifiers MUST reconstruct the domain separator and artifact hash(es) independently and MUST NOT trust either supplied as-is by a counterparty. (SIG-3) Signatures whose payload computation cannot be reproduced exactly MUST be rejected. (SIG-4) An artifact kind not in the v0.1 table MUST use a domain separator of the form "dacs-x-" || kind || ":v" || version || ":" until accepted into a future version of the registry. (SIG-5) **Preserve-unknown.** A verifier MUST reconstruct the signed payload (canonical form and artifact hash) over the document **as received**, including any fields it does not recognise. It MUST NOT strip, drop, or otherwise omit unrecognised fields before recomputing the canonical form — doing so changes the hash and would reject a validly-signed document produced under a later minor version. A verifier MAY ignore the *meaning* of unknown fields but MUST include their bytes in the hash. This is what makes the "forward-readable shapes" guarantee of §11.1.2 hold for signed artifacts: an older verifier can still verify a newer minor version's signature, interpreting only the fields it knows.
**Algorithm.** The signing algorithm itself (Ed25519, ECDSA-secp256k1, or sr1-aggregate) is independent of the domain-separation rule. The domain separator is prepended to the signed bytes regardless of algorithm. Implementations MUST NOT compute a signature over the artifact hash without the separator and MUST NOT compute a signature over the canonical form directly (always over the prepended-separator-then-hash payload). `artifact_hash` MUST be the lowercase hex string of the sha256 digest; the `domain_separator` (a UTF-8 string) and `artifact_hash` (an ASCII hex string) are concatenated as UTF-8 byte sequences with no separator byte.

## Chapter 6 — DACS-1: Identify

**Stage:** Identify (1st of 5). **Status:** Draft (part of DACS v0.1). **Depends on:** SR-1 (optional), SR-2 (required); composes with ERC-8004, W3C DIDs, A2A. **Used by:** DACS-2..5.

### 6.1 Abstract

DACS-1 specifies how an agent is identified, what it offers, and how it is found. It defines three artifacts and a discovery extension:

- An **identity claim reference scheme** — a typed reference to an identifier in some external system (did:…, erc8004:…, lei:…, domain:…, platform:google:…), optionally paired with a verification method drawn from DACS-2.
- An **identity bundle schema** — an ordered set of claims a party presents about itself, each independently verifiable, plus a listing-side requirement schema declaring which bundles a listing will accept.
- A **service listing schema** — a signed, anchored JSON document declaring an agent’s identity-bundle requirement, offering, deliverable, the DACS pipeline of stages to execute, accepted payment rails, and terms. The listing is the canonical contract for any transaction against this seller.
- A **discovery extension** — an extension to .well-known/agent.json declaring a listings index URL, plus an off-chain catalog API for indexed search across listings.

Identity is treated as a bundle of independently-verified claims rather than a single rooted identifier. This lets the same standard cover micropayments (a signing key is enough) and regulated trades (LEI + KYB + FINRA + OFAC) without changing structure. The substrate MUST provide anchored storage for listings and bundles (SR-2); single-signature bundle convenience (SR-1) is OPTIONAL and supplements but does not replace per-claim verification.

### 6.2 Motivation

The Identify stage answers three questions a buyer must resolve before any transaction proceeds: *who is the counterparty?* (cryptographically, at a level of confidence appropriate to the stakes); *what do they offer, on what terms?*; *how are they found in the first place when only the offering is known?*
Existing open standards address fragments. ERC-8004 provides an EVM-native agent identity (an NFT). W3C DIDs provide a methodology for self-sovereign identifiers. A2A’s .well-known/agent.json provides capability advertisement. Authority-issued identifiers (LEI, FINRA CRD, SAM.gov UEI) and platform identifiers (verified domains, OAuth-backed accounts) exist outside the standards space but carry real commercial weight. None of these — alone or combined — provide: a way to *declare* which set of claims a transaction requires; a way to *present* a matching set with per-claim verification references; a signed, anchored *listing* document that is itself the binding contract for the transaction; a *commercial discovery* surface distinct from capability advertisement.
DACS-1 fills these gaps with the smallest possible additions, composing with each existing standard where it fits. The stakes-graduated nature of agent commerce is the reason a single-rooted-identity model does not work: identity for a sub-cent API micropayment is a signing key; identity for a $500 B2B SaaS purchase is a signing key plus a small bundle of platform identities plus reputation; identity for a $50k institutional trade is an LEI as the identifier-of-record, with FINRA registration, OFAC clearance, and possibly a deal-specific KYB attestation. The same standard must work across all three.
The unification mechanism is **claims, not roots**. A listing requires a bundle of claims; a counterparty presents one. The bundle has a presentation signature (which MAY be a single SR-1 root signature, per-claim signatures, or a presentation signature by a session key). The rest of the stack consumes the bundle uniformly.

### 6.3 Specification

#### 6.3.1 Identity claim reference scheme

A claim reference identifies a fact about a party that can in principle be verified against an external system.
**Grammar**
A claim reference MUST conform to:

```
ClaimReference   := Scheme ":" Identifier [ "?" Parameters ]

Scheme           := scheme-start ( scheme-cont )*

scheme-start     := lowercase-ascii

scheme-cont      := lowercase-ascii | digit | "-"

Identifier       := scheme-specific, non-empty, NFC-normalized Unicode (printable ASCII recommended)

Parameters       := key1=value1 [ "&" key2=value2 ]*
```

A Scheme MUST start with a lowercase ASCII letter and MAY include lowercase ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens thereafter. Underscores are reserved for future use and MUST NOT appear in v0.1 scheme names. Parsers MUST treat Scheme case-insensitively on read and SHOULD emit lowercase on write. Identifier is treated per-scheme; the per-scheme rules below specify canonicalisation. The ?<parameters> suffix carries scheme-specific qualifiers (e.g. cci-xm:evm:mainnet:0x…?jurisdiction=US). Unknown parameters MUST be ignored by readers, MUST NOT cause rejection, and MUST NOT be silently stripped when forwarding the reference.
**Canonical form and identity (rules CF-2, CF-3).** A ClaimReference has a *canonical byte form* — what is embedded whenever the reference appears inside a hashed or signed document, so the JCS canonical form is reproducible — and a *canonical identity* — what is compared for matching, reputation keying, and the §7.3.2 cross-session replay defence. The two are distinct:

- (CF-2) **Canonical byte form.** Before a ClaimReference is embedded in any document that is JCS-canonicalised, hashed, signed, or compared, it MUST be in canonical form: (a) **Scheme** lowercased — this promotes the SHOULD-emit-lowercase above to a MUST for any reference that is hashed, signed, or compared; (b) **Identifier** NFC-normalised (rule CF-1, §7.2) and otherwise per the scheme's identifier rule below; (c) **Parameters**, if present, sorted by key in Unicode code-point order and joined with the fixed `&`/`=` separators, with the reserved characters `:`, `?`, `&`, `=`, and `%` percent-encoded using uppercase hex (e.g. `%3A`). Sorting parameters into canonical order is NOT the "silent stripping" prohibited by the forwarding rule above — no parameter is dropped, only deterministically ordered.
- (CF-3) **Canonical identity.** The identity of a party for matching, reputation keying, and replay defence is the pair (canonical Scheme, canonical Identifier) **only**. Parameters are advisory qualifiers and MUST NOT contribute to identity: `cci-xm:evm:mainnet:0xA?jurisdiction=US` and `cci-xm:evm:mainnet:0xA` are the same party and MUST key to the same reputation record. Wherever this specification requires two references to match "canonically" or "by canonical scheme and identifier" (§6.3.2, §7.3.2, §6.6), it means equality of this (Scheme, Identifier) pair after CF-1/CF-2 normalisation.

**Registered schemes (v0.1) — two-axis registry**
The v0.1 scheme registry is organised along two axes: (a) **CCI-native** schemes — one per Demos CCI context, with the identifier directly addressing the relevant slot in GCRMain.identities; (b) **Stor-backed credential** schemes — schemes whose verification result is anchored as a Storage Program written by a DACS-2 attestation.
**CCI-native schemes** — map to Demos CCI contexts (8 in production today + 6 to-add for DACS-1 v0.1):

| Scheme | CCI context | Identifier shape | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cci-xm:<chain>:<subchain>:<address> | xm | per chain (EVM hex, Solana base58, …) | Done |
| cci-web2:<platform>:<username> | web2 | twitter / github / discord / telegram | Done |
| cci-pqc:<algorithm>:<pubkey> | pqc | falcon / ml-dsa | Done |
| cci-ud:<domain> | ud | Unstoppable Domain | Done |
| cci-nomis:<address> | nomis | Nomis wallet score subject | Done |
| cci-humanpassport:<id> | humanpassport | humanity proof id | Done |
| cci-ethos:<id> | ethos | Ethos profile id | Done |
| cci-tlsn:<proof-hash> | tlsn | TLSNotary proof commitment | Done — DACS-2 MUST treat as a CCI claim, NOT as an external tlsnotary method |
| cci-lei:<20-char> | lei (NEW) | uppercase LEI | GCR routine to build |
| cci-finra-crd:<digits> | finra-crd (NEW) | digits only, no leading zeros | GCR routine to build |
| cci-sam-uei:<12-char> | sam-uei (NEW) | uppercase UEI | GCR routine to build |
| cci-fedramp:<id> | fedramp (NEW) | as-issued | GCR routine to build |
| cci-naics:<6-digit> | naics (NEW) | digits only | GCR routine to build |
| cci-cmmc:<cert-id> | cmmc (NEW) | as-issued | GCR routine to build |

The six new contexts (lei, finra-crd, sam-uei, fedramp, naics, cmmc) extend the existing 8-context CCI model with the regulatory identity claims DACS-1 v0.1 needs. Each follows the same pattern as the existing 8 contexts: per-context GCR routine for validation; verified payload stored in GCRMain.identities; readable via the existing wallet/SDK identity surface.
**The DACS-1 / DACS-2 boundary for these claims.** DACS-1 is **registered identity** (what the party stably holds — LEI, FINRA registration, etc., kept in CCI). DACS-2 is **freshness check** (per-session re-verification that the registered claim is still valid right now). The DACS-2 DAHR call against the authority produces the verified result; that result is written into the relevant CCI context (DACS-1 surface) AND referenced from the DACS-2 CompositeVerificationRecord for that session.
**Stor-backed credential schemes (extensibility surface)**
For credentials Demos has not yet promoted to a native CCI context — future regulatory regimes, jurisdiction-specific identifiers, industry-specific certifications, ad-hoc one-off attestations — DACS-1 allows a Stor-backed scheme of the form:
stor-cred:<credential-type>:<identifier>
The Storage Program at stor-{sha256(subject_cci + ":" + credential-type + ":" + identifier)} holds the latest DACS-2 VerifyResult for that (subject, credential) tuple. This is the extensibility mechanism: when a new credential type is needed and there is no native CCI context for it, listings can require a stor-cred:*scheme without waiting for Demos to add a context. When a stor-cred:* scheme sees broad enough use, it SHOULD graduate to a native CCI context per the v2 scheme-addition process.
**Composition and low-stakes schemes**

| Scheme | Identifier shape | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| did:… | per W3C DID method | external decentralised identifier; resolution per method |
| erc8004:<chainId>:<contract>:<tokenId> | <chainId> is an eip155 chain id as a bare decimal integer (no leading zeros), canonically the CAIP-2 chain id eip155:<chainId>; lowercase 0x-prefixed contract; tokenId is the uint256 token id in decimal, no leading zeros | external EVM agent identity NFT; verified via DACS-2 evm-rpc |
| domain:<dns> | lowercase, IDNA-encoded | DNS / TLS control proof via DACS-2 domain-tls-control |
| key:<hex-pubkey> | lowercase, no 0x | self-signed; lowest tier; signing-key only |
| substrate-validator-set:<substrateId>:<epochOrSetId> | registered substrateId + epoch/set id | not a party identity — the signer of a consensus-backed-proxy / evm-rpc DACS-2 attestation; resolution + roster verification per §7.5 |

**Unknown-scheme handling**
A reader encountering an unknown scheme MUST: preserve the reference verbatim when forwarding; treat the reference as **unverified** for evaluation purposes; NOT silently accept the reference as satisfying a bundle requirement; log or surface the unknown scheme to the calling agent. A reader MAY decline to engage with a bundle that contains an unknown scheme in a required position.
**Adding new schemes (v2 and beyond)**
The v0.1 scheme registry is closed. New schemes are added in subsequent versions of DACS-1 by: submitting a scheme definition (name, identifier grammar, canonical form, authority, default DACS-2 verification recipe); demonstrating a working DACS-2 recipe; acceptance by the registry steward per the process in chapter 11. Implementations MAY support pre-standard "experimental" schemes prefixed x- (e.g., x-myorg-internal-id); these MUST be treated as unknown by conforming readers unless out-of-band agreement exists.

#### 6.3.2 Identity bundle

An identity bundle is an ordered set of claims a party presents about itself, with verification metadata, plus a presentation signature.
**Schema**

```
type IdentityBundle = {

  bundleVersion: "1"

  presentedBy: ClaimReference          // primary identity claim within `claims`

  presentedAt: number                  // unix milliseconds (always present — see §6.3.2)

  sessionNonce?: string                // session-binding nonce for per-claim / session-key presentations; top-level so it enters bundle_hash (§6.3.2). SIWD conveys the nonce in the SIWD message Nonce field instead.

  claims: BundleClaim[]                // non-empty; order is meaningful

  presentation: PresentationSignature

}

type BundleClaim = {

  ref: ClaimReference

  verifiedBy?: VerifyResultRef         // DACS-2 result reference

  issuedAt?: number                    // unix ms when the verification was performed

  expiresAt?: number                   // unix ms when verifiedBy becomes stale

  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>   // scheme-specific

}

type PresentationSignature =

  | { kind: "siwd"; message: string; signature: string; address: string }

  | { kind: "per-claim"; signatures: { ref: ClaimReference; signature: string }[] }

  | { kind: "session-key"; key: string; signature: string; rootBinding?: string }

  | { kind: "sr1-root"; rootClaim: ClaimReference; aggregateSignature: string }
```

SIWD is the preferred presentation. The siwd shape matches the return of provider.request({ method: "wallet_signIn", params: […] }) on the Demos wallet — { message, signature, address } — and is the same EIP-4361-style envelope. Verifiers MUST validate the SIWD signature against the **Demos wallet's signing key** (the wallet that produced `wallet_signIn`). The bundle's primary claim MAY be on any chain (EVM, Solana, …) — it is bound to that wallet through the wallet's verified **CCI / SR-1 cross-chain identity link**, NOT by requiring the primary claim itself to produce the EIP-4361 signature. A verifier MUST confirm the wallet controls the primary claim via that CCI/SR-1 link (the Demos wallet is the identity root that holds the per-chain claims). A primary claim with no CCI link to a SIWD-capable wallet MUST use the `per-claim` or `sr1-root` presentation instead.
**sr1-root presentation.** When SR-1 cross-substrate identity aggregation is available, a single root key may co-sign every claim in the bundle under an SR-1 aggregate signature, producing one signature that covers the whole bundle. rootClaim names the SR-1 root identity (a CCI primary claim on Demos); aggregateSignature is the SR-1 aggregate signature over the domain-separated payload (§6.3.2 below). Verifiers MUST resolve the root key via SR-1 and verify the aggregate signature against the domain-separated payload `signed_bytes` (§6.3.2). sr1-root is the natural presentation for a party self-binding a single document (a seller signing their own listing, an orchestrator binding multiple per-substrate addresses under one identity) because it avoids the per-claim signature overhead and produces one cryptographic artifact that the rest of the stack can reason about.
**Domain-separated payload.** All four presentation kinds sign the same canonical payload:
signed_bytes := "dacs-bundle-presentation:v1:" || bundle_hash
For the siwd kind, the SIWD message string MUST include the canonical hex-encoded signed_bytes value as a "Resource" line per EIP-4361 so the SIWD signature transitively binds to the same payload (the message is the SIWD envelope, the resource carries the bundle binding). For the per-claim kind, each per-claim signature signs signed_bytes (not the raw bundle hash). For the session-key kind, the session key signs signed_bytes; if rootBinding is set, the root key’s binding signature signs "dacs-session-binding:v1:" || session_key || bundle_hash. For the sr1-root kind, the SR-1 aggregate signature signs signed_bytes; verifiers reconstruct the SR-1 aggregate from the rootClaim’s sub-identity set and verify against signed_bytes.
**Session nonce binding.** `presentedAt` is always present (a required schema field). A bundle presented in the context of a specific session SHOULD additionally carry a session-binding nonce. The nonce is conveyed via the SIWD message’s Nonce field (per EIP-4361) or, for per-claim and session-key presentations, via the top-level `sessionNonce` field on the IdentityBundle (which therefore enters `bundle_hash` and is covered by the presentation signature for those kinds). A verifier in a session context MUST check that the bundle’s `sessionNonce` (or SIWD Nonce) matches the session’s expected nonce, and MUST reject a session-context presentation that carries no session nonce. (For SIWD the nonce lives in the omitted `presentation` field and so is not in `bundle_hash`; the verifier's nonce-match check above is the binding for that kind and is therefore a MUST, not advisory.) Bundles presented without session-nonce binding are usable only outside session contexts (e.g., listing publication where the bundle is the seller’s own self-binding to the listing).
**Canonical serialisation**
A bundle’s canonical form is the RFC 8785 JCS serialisation of the bundle with the presentation field omitted. The bundle hash is sha256(canonical_form), hex-encoded. The domain-separated signed_bytes (above) is what the presentation signature actually signs. Verifiers MUST recompute both the canonical form and the domain-separated payload when validating.
**presentedBy selection rule**
presentedBy MUST be one of the claim references appearing in claims (matching by canonical scheme and identifier). If the listing’s BundleRequirement.primaryClaimSelector is set, the presenter SHOULD select the highest-tier claim of the matching scheme. If no selector is set, the presenter SHOULD select the highest-tier claim available, where tiers (highest to lowest) are: authority-issued (lei, finra-crd, sam-uei, fedramp, cmmc, naics); ERC-8004 / W3C DID with verifiable proof; platform identifiers; plain signing keys. Readers MUST accept any presentedBy value that resolves to a claim in claims; a reader MAY prefer a higher-tier alternative for display or reputation lookup but MUST NOT reject a bundle solely because presentedBy is not the highest-tier claim. **Reputation MUST NOT be keyed against an unverified `presentedBy` claim**, regardless of whether `primaryClaimSelector` is set: if the resolved `presentedBy` claim has a verifiable scheme but lacks a passing `verifiedBy`, consumers MUST treat it as the lowest (plain signing-key) tier for reputation purposes (or reject), so an unverified high-tier identifier (e.g. an `lei:` the presenter does not control) cannot launder reputation onto itself. The MA-3 verified-presentedBy check (§6.3.3) enforces this at match time when a selector is set; this rule extends the same protection to the no-selector case where reputation still keys on `presentedBy` (§6.6, §10.5.2).
**Verification reference resolution**
For a BundleClaim with verifiedBy present: the reader fetches the VerifyResultRef.anchor.locator from the indicated kind; canonicalises the fetched content to its RFC 8785 canonical form and compares sha256(canonical_form) to VerifyResultRef.contentHash (mismatch MUST cause rejection; a VerifyResult is always a canonical-JSON DACS document per §7.5, so only this canonical-form branch applies to a VerifyResultRef — raw-byte attestations are handled in §7.5.2); parses the canonicalised content as a DACS-2 VerifyResult and verifies it matches the recipe at recipeVersion; checks that the VerifyResult.identifier matches the BundleClaim.ref identifier component canonically; checks that VerifyResult.decision == "pass". If any step fails, the claim is treated as unverified for evaluation against bundle requirements.
**Staleness**
A verifiedBy reference is stale when now > BundleClaim.expiresAt, or, when expiresAt is absent, when now − issuedAt > recipe.defaultMaxAgeSec × 1000 (`now` and `issuedAt` are unix milliseconds while `defaultMaxAgeSec` is seconds, so the age threshold MUST be converted to milliseconds before the comparison). When both `expiresAt` and `issuedAt` are absent, the reference MUST be treated as stale (fail-closed) — an unknown age MUST NOT pass the freshness gate. A stale verification MUST be refreshed during the Vet stage (DACS-2) for any claim that is required by the listing’s BundleRequirement.
**Conformance — bundles**
A conforming bundle producer MUST: (BP-1) produce JCS-canonical serialisation for hashing and signing; (BP-2) include at least one claim; (BP-3) provide presentedBy that resolves to a claim; (BP-4) provide a presentation signature that verifies against the domain-separated presentation payload `signed_bytes` (`"dacs-bundle-presentation:v1:" || bundle_hash`, §6.3.2) — not the raw bundle hash.
A conforming bundle reader MUST: (BR-1) recompute the bundle hash from canonical form before signature check; (BR-2) reject a bundle whose presentation signature does not verify; (BR-3) reject a bundle in which a required (per listing) claim has a missing or invalid verifiedBy when verificationRequired = true; (BR-4) treat claims with unknown schemes as unverified; (BR-5) when the listing sets primaryClaimSelector, reject a bundle whose presentedBy claim is not itself verified (missing or failing verifiedBy), even when its scheme matches the selector — see the §6.3.3 match() step that enforces this, preventing tier-laundering where an unverified primary claim rides on separately-verified required claims.
**Selective disclosure (scope note).** v0.1 provides no per-claim selective-disclosure mechanism at the bundle layer: there is no per-claim blinding, no commitment-with-open-on-demand, and no proof-of-possession-without-disclosure for a claim a listing did not require. A verifier that receives a bundle sees every claim in `claims[]`, and the `presentedBy` primary claim is always disclosed and is the cross-session correlator used for reputation and audit (§6.4 Rationale, §6.3.4). The DACS-2 zkTLS / TLSNotary methods (§7.3.3 tlsnotary, §7.3.4 zktls) protect the secret *inside* a claim's verification; they do NOT conceal *which* claims a party holds from a counterparty. The only minimisation available in v0.1 is presenter-side: a presenter MAY publish a bundle containing only the claims a given listing requires, accepting that the primary claim remains linkable across presentations. Implementers MUST NOT treat DACS-1 + a privacy-preserving DACS-2 method as an end-to-end selective-disclosure guarantee. Blinded / minimised-claim presentation is a named follow-on item (§11.2.7).

#### 6.3.3 Bundle requirement schema

A listing declares which bundles it will accept.

```
type BundleRequirement = {

  requirementVersion: "1"

  required: ClaimRequirement[]         // all MUST be satisfied

  oneOf?: ClaimRequirement[][]         // at least one inner group MUST be satisfied

  preferredPresentation?: "siwd" | "sr1-root" | "per-claim" | "session-key" | "any"

  primaryClaimSelector?: string        // scheme whose identifier MUST be `presentedBy`

}

type ClaimRequirement = {

  scheme: string                       // e.g. "lei"

  verificationRequired: boolean

  maxAge?: number                      // seconds; overrides recipe default

  recipeVersion?: number               // pin a specific DACS-2 recipe version (§7.4.1); else latest-at-session-start

  parameters?: Record<string, unknown> // scheme-specific

}
```

**Matching algorithm**
A reader MUST evaluate a candidate IdentityBundle against a BundleRequirement using the following deterministic algorithm:

```
match(bundle, requirement):

  1. (MA-1) For each cr in requirement.required:

       if NOT find_claim(bundle, cr): return REJECT("missing required: <cr.scheme>")

  2. (MA-1) For each group in (requirement.oneOf or []):

       any_satisfied := false

       for each cr in group:

         if find_claim(bundle, cr): any_satisfied := true; break

       if NOT any_satisfied: return REJECT("oneOf group unsatisfied")

  3. (MA-2) If requirement.primaryClaimSelector is set:

       if bundle.presentedBy.scheme != requirement.primaryClaimSelector: return REJECT

  3b. (MA-3) If requirement.primaryClaimSelector is set:

       // The exact claim presentedBy resolves to MUST itself be verified — not merely some claim of the selector scheme.

       // Otherwise a presenter could launder reputation by pairing an unverified (or third-party) presentedBy identifier with a *different*, already-verified claim of the same scheme.

       presented := the claim c in bundle.claims whose c.ref matches bundle.presentedBy by canonical scheme AND identifier (the §6.3.2 presentedBy resolution rule)

       if presented is null: return REJECT   // presentedBy does not resolve to a claim in the bundle

       if presented.verifiedBy missing OR resolution fails OR (the VerifyResult resolved from presented.verifiedBy).decision != "pass": return REJECT   // decision is read from the resolved VerifyResult, not from VerifyResultRef

  4. If requirement.preferredPresentation is set AND != "any":

       if bundle.presentation.kind != requirement.preferredPresentation: return WARN, accept

  5. return ACCEPT

find_claim(bundle, cr):

  for each c in bundle.claims:

    if c.ref.scheme != cr.scheme: continue

    if cr.verificationRequired AND (c.verifiedBy missing OR resolution fails OR (the VerifyResult resolved from c.verifiedBy).decision != "pass"): continue

    // Freshness gate. The §6.3.4 staleness rule applies UNCONDITIONALLY (even when cr.maxAge is unset),
    // using the recipe default; cr.maxAge, when present, only tightens it. Absent issuedAt/expiresAt fails closed.
    if c is stale per §6.3.4 — i.e. (c.expiresAt set AND now > c.expiresAt) OR (c.expiresAt unset AND (c.issuedAt is null OR (now - c.issuedAt) > recipe(c.ref.scheme).defaultMaxAgeSec * 1000)): continue
    if cr.maxAge AND (c.issuedAt is null OR (now - c.issuedAt) > cr.maxAge * 1000): continue   // listing-tightened bound (overrides the recipe default downward); now, c.issuedAt in unix ms; cr.maxAge in seconds → ×1000

    if cr.parameters AND NOT scheme_specific_match(c, cr.parameters): continue

    return c

  return null
```

scheme_specific_match is defined per scheme in DACS-2 recipes. Where parameters are unrecognised, readers MUST treat the requirement as unmatched (not silently passed).
**Failure mode and selector semantics**
A BundleRequirement that does not match MUST cause the buyer or seller to refuse to advance the transaction past the Vet stage. v0.1 specifies no downgrade or renegotiation path. The primaryClaimSelector controls which claim’s identifier is used as the reputation key in DACS-5 and the counterparty identifier of record for audit purposes. Listings that handle regulated flows SHOULD set primaryClaimSelector to an authority-issued scheme (e.g., lei) to ensure reputation accumulates against a stable, externally-verifiable identifier rather than a session key.

#### 6.3.4 Service listing

The listing is the canonical contract for a transaction.
**Schema**

```
type Listing = {

  // Versioning

  dacsVersion: "1"

  listingVersion: number               // monotonic per listingId, starts at 1

  listingId: string                    // unique per seller; URL-safe ASCII; max 128 chars

  requiredCapabilities?: SubstrateRequirement[]

  // Seller

  seller: {

    identity: IdentityBundle           // seller's own bundle

    displayName: string                // max 200 chars

    publicEndpoint?: string            // optional HTTPS endpoint

  }

  // Offering

  offering: {

    title: string                      // max 200 chars

    description: string                // max 2000 chars

    category: string                   // dot-delimited (e.g. "data.finance.fx")

    tags: string[]                     // max 16 tags, max 32 chars each

    deliverable: DeliverableSpec       // per DACS-4

    extendedDescriptionUrl?: string

    extendedDescriptionHash?: string

  }

  // Buyer requirement

  buyerRequirement: BundleRequirement

  // Pipeline of phases to execute, per DACS-3/4/5

  pipeline: PhaseStep[]                // non-empty, ordered

  // Pricing and accepted rails, per DACS-4

  pricing: PricingSpec

  acceptedRails?: PaymentRailRef[]      // OPTIONAL: required and non-empty IF pipeline contains any pay-* phase

  // Terms

  terms: ListingTerms

  // Validity window

  validity: {

    notBefore: number                  // unix ms

    notAfter?: number                  // unix ms; absent => no expiry

  }

  // Listing-level signature

  signature: ListingSignature

}

type SubstrateRequirement =

  | "SR-1" | "SR-2" | "SR-3" | "SR-4" | "SR-5"

type ListingTerms = {

  termsOfServiceUrl?: string

  termsOfServiceHash?: string

  jurisdictions?: string[]             // ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes

  conflictOfLawsRule?: "buyer-jurisdiction" | "seller-jurisdiction" | "rule-ref:<uri>"

  deadlineSecAfterCommit?: number

  acceptanceModel?: "auto-accept"      // §8.4.1; when set, the seller pre-issues an AutoAcceptCommitment instead of a per-session signature

  cancellationPolicy?: "none" | "pre-commit" | "with-fee"   // v0.1: informational only — see note below

  retentionYears?: number

  transcriptDisclosurePolicy?: "none" | "encrypted-anchored-recommended" | "encrypted-anchored-required"

}
```

**`cancellationPolicy` is informational-only in v0.1.** The field MAY be advertised, but v0.1 gives it no enforced representation: there is no `cancelled` SessionState or AttestationBundle `outcome`, and a session that ends before completion records `aborted-by-self` / `aborted-by-other` per §10.3.1 regardless of any advertised policy. Counterparties MUST NOT treat an advertised `pre-commit` / `with-fee` policy as a binding, reputation-neutral exit in v0.1; the §10.3.1 abort semantics (and their §10.5 reputation treatment) govern. A first-class, reputation-neutral `cancelled` outcome — honouring a pre-agreed cancellation without it reading as a fault — is a roadmap candidate (it composes with the ST-3 "withdrawal is a right" framing).

```
type ListingSignature = {

  algorithm: "ed25519" | "ecdsa-secp256k1" | "sr1-aggregate"

  signer: ClaimReference               // MUST appear in seller.identity.claims

  value: string                        // signature over the domain-separated listing payload ("dacs-listing:v1:" || listing_hash), per §6.3.4

}
```

DeliverableSpec, PricingSpec, and PaymentRailRef are normatively defined in chapter 9 (DACS-4). PhaseStep is defined below. A listing MUST use types that conform to the cited specs.
**PhaseStep schema**

```
type PhaseStep = {

  kind: PhaseType                           // closed v0.1 set below

  parameters?: Record<string, unknown>      // per-`kind` shape defined in the owning spec

}

type PhaseType =

  // DACS-2

  | "vet-credentials"

  // DACS-3

  | "negotiate-fixed-price" | "negotiate-rfq" | "negotiate-sealed-envelope" | "commit-agreement"

  // DACS-4

  | "pay-evm-erc20" | "pay-solana-spl"

  | "pay-cross-chain-htlc" | "pay-cross-chain-liquidity-tank"

  | "pay-ap2" | "pay-x402"

  | "deliver-storage-program" | "deliver-entitlement" | "deliver-attested-payload"

  // DACS-5

  | "rate"
```

Per-kind parameter shapes are normative in the owning chapter: vet-credentials — no parameters; negotiate-fixed-price — no parameters; negotiate-rfq — {maxTurns, timeoutSec, channelSubnet?, rfqInitiator?} per chapter 8; negotiate-sealed-envelope — {commitDeadline, revealWindow, selectionRule, channelSubnet?} per chapter 8; commit-agreement — no parameters; pay-*— {rail: string} (railId) per chapter 9; deliver-* — no parameters (details come from the listing’s DeliverableSpec); rate — optional {required?: boolean} per chapter 10.
**Canonical serialisation and signature**
A listing’s canonical form is the RFC 8785 JCS serialisation with the signature field omitted. The listing hash is sha256(canonical_form), hex-encoded. The signature.value is computed over the domain-separated payload per chapter 7§7.7:
signed_bytes := "dacs-listing:v1:" || listing_hash
Verifiers MUST: recompute the canonical form, listing hash, and domain-separated signed bytes; resolve signature.signer to the corresponding key (via seller.identity.claims, then via DACS-2 verification if a verifiable identifier); verify the signature against signed_bytes. If signature.algorithm is sr1-aggregate, the signer’s IdentityBundle.presentation MUST be of kind sr1-root and the signature is the SR-1 root signature over signed_bytes (the SR-1 aggregate signature scheme applies to the same domain-separated payload, not directly to the listing hash).
**Anchoring and size limits**
A listing MUST be anchored using SR-2.
**Logical address vs native address.** DACS specifies a *logical* address pattern for each artifact kind. The logical pattern for a listing is dacs1:{sellerPrimaryClaim}:{listingId}:v{listingVersion}. The logical pattern is a stable, substrate-independent identifier the protocol reasons about; it is not necessarily the literal string the substrate accepts as an address. Each substrate-binding section specifies how the logical pattern maps to the substrate’s native addressing.
**Demos binding.** On Demos, the substrate’s StorageProgram addressing requires colon-free names and resolves writes to a sha256-derived handle of the form stor-<hex>. The Demos binding for a DACS listing therefore is:

```
logical_address    := "dacs1:" + sellerPrimaryClaim + ":" + listingId + ":v" + listingVersion   // CF-4-encoded segments
storageProgramName := colon-free encoding of logical_address   // Demos rejects ":" in names

// Actual StorageProgram address derivation (SDK: storage/StorageProgram.ts):
native_address     := "stor-" + first40hex( sha256( deployerAddress + ":" + storageProgramName + ":" + nonce + ":" + salt ) )
```

Because the derivation folds in the **deployer address** and the **per-write transaction nonce** (and truncates to 40 hex / 160 bits), the native address is **not** recomputable from the logical address alone — this is the write-input-mapping case of the front-matter universal rule. Implementations on Demos MUST therefore: (a) anchor at native_address; (b) carry logical_address (in CF-4-encoded form) as descriptive metadata on the anchored record; and (c) publish the logical→native binding via the listings index (§6.3.5) and catalog (§6.3.6). Consumers resolve a listing by looking up native_address for the logical_address through the published binding, then reading the StorageProgram at native_address and verifying the content hash. The anchor transaction (the on-chain write) is the canonical pointer; the substrate’s native address is the addressable handle.

*Forward note.* A future SDK capability to anchor a StorageProgram at a caller-chosen address — or a Demos-native deterministic `logical → native` function that hashes only the logical address — would restore direct recomputation (the pure-mapping case) and let consumers resolve without the published binding. Until then the binding-publication requirement above governs.

**Rule CF-4 (logical-address delimiter encoding).** A `dacsN:` logical address is colon-delimited, but two of its variable segments can themselves contain the `:` delimiter (and, for a ClaimReference, also `?`, `&`, `=`): `sellerPrimaryClaim` is a ClaimReference (e.g. `cci-xm:evm:mainnet:0x1234`), and `listingId` is a free identifier. Left raw, the boundaries between segments are undecidable from the string alone, so the universal reversibility guarantee (front-matter §"Logical vs native addresses") is unsatisfiable on any substrate that parses the logical address directly. Therefore: every variable segment embedded in a logical address (`sellerPrimaryClaim`, `listingId`, and the equivalent segments of derived addresses) MUST have its reserved delimiters — `:`, `?`, `&`, `=`, `%` — percent-encoded with uppercase hex **before** the address is assembled. `sellerPrimaryClaim` MUST already be in CF-2 canonical form before encoding. This is the same `%3A`-style encoding the specification already uses for `primaryClaimRef` in the discovery/catalog surface. After encoding, the only unescaped colons are the fixed structural delimiters, so a reader knowing the pattern splits on them and percent-decodes each segment back to its exact original value. Worked example — primary claim `cci-xm:evm:mainnet:0x1234`, `listingId` `my-listing`, version 3:

```
logical_address := "dacs1:cci-xm%3Aevm%3Amainnet%3A0x1234:my-listing:v3"
```

The CF-4-encoded `logical_address` is the reversibly-parseable canonical identifier; how it maps to a substrate's *native* address (pure recomputation vs published write-input binding) is governed by the front-matter universal rule and, for Demos specifically, the Demos-binding block above — CF-4 does **not** itself assert a native-address formula. CF-4 applies identically to the listing logical address, the `dacs1-revoked:{sellerPrimaryClaim}:{listingId}:v{listingVersion}` revocation marker, and the DACS-5 role-specific bundle addresses (§10.4.3).
Substrates MAY use equivalent addressing schemes; the requirement is that any party with substrate access can dereference an anchor reference to the canonical content and verify the content hash.
**Size cap.** The canonical JSON form of a listing MUST NOT exceed 16,384 bytes (16 KB). Listings exceeding the cap MUST use the extendedDescriptionUrl + extendedDescriptionHash pattern to host verbose offering descriptions externally with content-hash binding. The cap applies after canonicalisation; the actual on-chain payload size may differ slightly due to substrate encoding. On substrates whose SR-2 implementation has a smaller per-record cap, the substrate cap governs (the lesser of 16 KB and the substrate cap). Implementations MUST reject listings exceeding the applicable cap at the validation step (LR-2).
**Versioning, immutability, revocation**
Each listingVersion is independently anchored. Prior versions MUST remain readable. A new version supersedes prior versions for new sessions; sessions already past commit-agreement (DACS-3) MUST continue against their pinned version. listingVersion MUST be monotonically increasing per listingId. Versions MUST NOT be skipped.
A seller MAY revoke a listing version by anchoring a revocation marker at the address dacs1-revoked:{sellerPrimaryClaim}:{listingId}:v{listingVersion} with value {listingId, listingVersion, listingContentHash, revokedAt, reason?, signature} signed by the same key that signed the listing. The `signature` is over the domain-separated payload `signed_bytes := "dacs-revocation:v1:" || sha256(canonical({listingId, listingVersion, listingContentHash, revokedAt, reason?}))` (per §7.7). The marker MUST carry `listingId`, `listingVersion`, and `listingContentHash` (the `contentHash` of the revoked listing version), and a reader MUST confirm all three match the listing it is checking before honouring the revocation — so a captured marker cannot be replayed to revoke a different listing (the anchor address alone is not a sufficient binding, since on Demos it is a write-input-derived native address, §6.3.4). Readers MUST check for the revocation marker before initiating a new session. Sessions already past commit-agreement MUST NOT be invalidated by revocation.
**Validation order for readers**
Readers MUST validate listings in the following order, halting on the first failure: (1) schema conformance; (2) dacsVersion supported; (3) validity.notBefore ≤ now ≤ validity.notAfter (if set); (4) canonical form well-formed and signature verifies; (5) revocation marker absent; (6) seller.identity bundle conformant per §6.3.2; (7) pipeline references valid phase types per DACS-3/4/5; (8) if pipeline contains any pay-*phase, acceptedRails MUST be present and non-empty and MUST reference resolvable payment rails per DACS-4; if pipeline contains no pay-* phase, acceptedRails MAY be absent (this is the intake-only listing pattern — RFP intake, reverse auctions where the bid is the commitment, free services gated by reputation, sealed-bid procurements settled out-of-band); (9) signer resolves to a key controllable by the seller.
**Conformance — listing publishers and readers**
A conforming publisher MUST: (LP-1) anchor each listingVersion via SR-2 before referencing it from a listing index; (LP-2) sign the listing with a key referenced by a claim in seller.identity.claims; (LP-3) use monotonic listingVersion values per listingId; (LP-4) publish revocation markers when withdrawing a listing.
A conforming reader MUST: (LR-1) pin the (listingId, listingVersion, contentHash) tuple into any session record derived from the listing; (LR-2) reject listings failing any step in the validation order; (LR-3) refuse new sessions against revoked listings.

#### 6.3.5 Discovery — .well-known/agent.json extension

The .well-known/agent.json document published at the agent’s domain is extended with a dacs block:

```
{

  // ... existing A2A agent-card fields ...

  "dacs": {

    "dacsVersion": "1",

    "listings": {

      "indexUrl": "https://example.com/.well-known/dacs/listings.json",

      "indexHash": "sha256-...",

      "anchor": {

        "kind": "storage-program",

        "address": "dacs1-index:..."

      }

    },

    "identityClaims": [

      "lei:984500ABCDEF12345678",

      "domain:example.com",

      "erc8004:1:0x...:42"

    ]

  }

}
```

**Listing index file (listings.json)**

```
type ListingIndex = {

  indexVersion: "1"

  generatedAt: number

  seller: ClaimReference

  listings: ListingIndexEntry[]

}

type ListingIndexEntry = {

  listingId: string

  version: number

  contentHash: string

  anchor: { kind: string; locator: string }

  summary: {

    title: string

    category: string

    tags: string[]

    priceHint?: string

  }

  status: "active" | "revoked"

}
```

The index MAY itself be anchored via SR-2; if so, the well-known block’s anchor field MUST point to it. The indexHash field in the well-known block enables clients to detect stale caches. Clients MUST cross-check each ListingIndexEntry.anchor independently before engaging with a listing; the index is for discovery convenience, not a source of truth.
**Interoperability with A2A; update and revocation**
The dacs block is additive. A2A-only clients ignore the dacs field. DACS-aware clients use the dacs field for listing discovery; absence of the field MUST be interpreted as "this agent does not publish DACS listings via well-known" (the agent MAY still have listings discoverable via a catalog API). Sellers update by re-publishing listings.json with new entries and updated generatedAt; the well-known indexHash MUST be updated to match. Revocation removes the entry from the index AND publishes the on-chain revocation marker.

#### 6.3.6 Discovery — catalog API

A DACS catalog is an off-chain index aggregating listings across many sellers, providing search, filtering, and discovery.
**Endpoints**

```
GET /api/dacs/listings

  Query parameters:

    category=<dot-delimited prefix>

    tag=<repeatable>

GET /api/dacs/listings/{listingId}/{version}

  Response: Listing (canonical JSON)

GET /api/dacs/sellers/{primaryClaimRef}

  Response: {

    "listings": ListingSummary[],

    "identity": IdentityBundle (catalog-cached, last-seen),

    "reputation": ReputationSummary (per DACS-5)

  }
```

primaryClaimRef is URL-encoded canonical form (e.g., lei%3A984500ABCDEF12345678).
**ListingSummary, caching, authentication, cross-reference**

```
type ListingSummary = {

  listingId: string

  version: number

  contentHash: string

  anchor: { kind: string; locator: string }

  seller: { primaryClaim: ClaimReference; displayName: string }

  offering: { title: string; category: string; tags: string[] }

  pricing: { priceHint?: string; currency?: string }

  status: "active" | "revoked"

  catalogObservedAt: number

  // Optional: catalog-computed reputation snapshot for this seller in the listing's category.
  // Derived from the seller's DACS-5 bundles scoped to offering.category using the
  // category-scoped derivation algorithm in §10.5.4. When present, consumers MAY use this
  // as a lightweight pre-filter; they MUST NOT treat it as authoritative without deriving
  // reputation themselves from the underlying bundles (§10.5.3 computation surfaces).
  reputationHint?: ReputationHint

}

// Lightweight reputation snapshot attached to a ListingSummary.
// Scoped to the listing's offering.category prefix (e.g. "data.finance")
// so buyers see reputation for relevant transaction types, not overall lifetime metrics.

type ReputationHint = {

  // The category scope used to filter the bundles for this derivation
  // (MUST equal or be a prefix of the listing's offering.category).
  categoryScope: string

  // Completion rate in [0, 1] across bundles scoped to categoryScope;
  // null when no qualifying bundles exist (same semantics as ReputationDerivation.metrics.completionRate).
  completionRate: number | null

  // Average seller rating across bundles scoped to categoryScope; null when none.
  averageSellerRating: number | null

  // Number of bundles in the derivation window that contributed to this hint.
  bundleCount: number

  // The DACS-5 derivation window applied (unix ms).
  windowStart: number
  windowEnd: number

  // When the catalog last computed this hint. Consumers SHOULD treat hints older
  // than 24 hours as stale and fall back to deriving reputation themselves.
  computedAt: number

}
```

Catalogs MAY return cached ListingSummary records. Clients MUST dereference the anchor to obtain the canonical Listing before engaging. The catalog provides discovery; the chain provides binding. Catalogs SHOULD verify each indexed listing’s anchor at least every 24 hours; the catalogObservedAt timestamp surfaces the catalog’s confidence.
Read endpoints MUST NOT require authentication. Write/registration semantics are out of scope for v0.1; the canonical source of truth is always the substrate-anchored listing, not the catalog entry. For every ListingSummary returned, a DACS-aware client MUST resolve the anchor to the on-chain content and validate the contentHash. The catalog’s role is to surface candidates; binding decisions MUST follow the substrate.

#### 6.3.7 Conformance summary

| Role | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Listing publisher | LP-1 anchor; LP-2 sign; LP-3 monotonic versions; LP-4 publish revocation markers |
| Listing reader | LR-1 pin tuple; LR-2 validate per validation order; LR-3 refuse revoked |
| Bundle producer | BP-1 JCS canonical; BP-2 non-empty claims; BP-3 valid presentedBy; BP-4 valid presentation signature |
| Bundle reader | BR-1 recompute hash; BR-2 reject invalid signature; BR-3 reject missing required verifiedBy; BR-4 treat unknown schemes as unverified; BR-5 reject unverified presentedBy when primaryClaimSelector set |
| Well-known publisher | Publish dacs block; keep indexHash current |
| Catalog operator | Open read endpoints; honour caching constraint; decline write endpoints by spec discretion |
| Catalog client | Dereference anchors before binding |

### 6.4 Rationale

**Identity-as-bundle vs single-rooted identifier.** A single-root model forces every listing to a single identity primitive. Either the primitive is weak enough for the lowest-stakes use case (a signing key, useless for institutional flows), or strong enough for the highest-stakes (an LEI, infeasible for $0.01 micropayments). The bundle model lets each listing declare its own minimum, and lets each counterparty present whatever set of claims they hold. Reputation is keyed against the *primary* claim of the bundle so that the same party accumulates separate reputation per tier — necessary to prevent a great signing-key reputation laundering into a brand-new LEI presentation.
**Closed scheme registry in v0.1 vs open.** An open registry from v0.1 produces fragmentation: parsers cannot validate bundles without runtime-loaded recipes; conformance becomes untestable. v0.1 ships a fixed set of schemes covering the high-volume cases (LEI, FINRA, SAM, OFAC, FedRAMP, plus self-sovereign and platform identifiers). New schemes ship with subsequent DACS-1 minor versions, via the steward’s acceptance process. x- experimental prefixes provide an escape valve for out-of-band agreement without diluting conformance.
**Listing as full JSON in anchored storage vs hash-only with off-chain content.** Full JSON anchoring ensures any party with substrate access can retrieve and verify the binding contract without dependency on off-chain availability. The trade-off is on-chain size; the normative 16 KB cap (§6.3.4) is chosen to keep anchoring cheap on every substrate while permitting verbose offering descriptions via the extendedDescriptionUrl + extendedDescriptionHash pattern. Listings whose essential terms cannot fit in 16 KB — multi-currency price tables, very large pipelines, complex deliverable specifications — are a v2 concern; v0.1 treats the cap as a forcing function toward listing simplicity.
**.well-known/agent.json extension vs separate discovery surface.** Extension preserves A2A interoperability and uses an existing pattern operators already deploy. A separate surface would require duplicate publishing and create discovery ambiguity. The dacs block is purely additive.
**Catalog API off-chain vs on-chain registry.** An on-chain catalog would centralise discovery as much as an operator catalog while being slower and more expensive. The chain holds the listings (source of truth); off-chain catalogs index for performance. Multiple competing catalogs can exist; clients dereference to chain for binding regardless of catalog choice.
**SR-1 optional vs required.** Requiring SR-1 would prevent DACS-1 implementations on substrates without cross-substrate identity aggregation, including most EVM chains. Optional SR-1 lets DACS-1 ship anywhere with anchored storage; SR-1 supplements with single-signature convenience where the substrate supports it.
**Per-claim verification references (verifiedBy).** A claim without a verification reference is a self-assertion; useful for low-stakes flows but not load-bearing for high-stakes ones. The verifiedBy reference is the load-bearing link: the rest of the stack (DACS-3 negotiation, DACS-5 audit) references *verifications*, not raw claims, when stakes matter.
**Cost model for anchored storage.** DACS-1 assumes the substrate’s anchored storage (SR-2) is economically viable for documents up to the soft size limit. On low-cost substrates (Demos, L2 rollups, IPFS+L1-anchored-hash) this is trivially true; on Ethereum L1 it would dominate listing economics. Implementations on high-cost substrates SHOULD use the extendedDescriptionUrl + extendedDescriptionHash pattern aggressively, anchor only the essential listing fields, and consider L2 / off-chain-with-hash patterns.

### 6.5 Backwards compatibility

**ERC-8004.** A DACS-1 listing’s seller.identity.claims MAY include a claim of scheme erc8004 referencing an Ethereum identity registry token. Verification follows the evm-rpc recipe in chapter 7 (DACS-2) — a proxy-attested EVM call confirming the token’s owner. The token’s reputation registry entries MAY additionally surface DACS-5 reputation derivations for EVM-side consumers, but DACS-1 does not require this.
**W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).** Claims of scheme did are W3C DIDs. Resolution follows the W3C DID method specification for the relevant method. The verification recipe varies by method: methods with cryptographic key material in the DID document resolve to a self-signed verification against that material; methods bound to verifiable credentials use verifiable-credential.
**A2A .well-known/agent.json.** The DACS extension is additive. A2A-only clients ignore the dacs block. A DACS-aware client that fetches .well-known/agent.json and finds no dacs block MUST NOT infer that the agent has no listings; it MAY fall back to a catalog API search.
**W3C Verifiable Credentials.** Bundle claims MAY have a verifiedBy reference whose backing DACS-2 method is verifiable-credential. The verification material is a W3C VC presented to the verifier; the verifier checks the VC signature, issuer, and freshness per the DACS-2 recipe.
**Future identity standards.** New identity schemes are added via the DACS-1 version process. DACS-1 is structured so adding a scheme requires only registry updates, not changes to the bundle, listing, or discovery schemas.

### 6.6 Security considerations

**Forged listings.** *Threat:* an attacker publishes a listing impersonating a known seller. *Mitigation:* listings are signed; the signer MUST be a key referenced in seller.identity.claims, and the bundle itself MUST verify. A reader following the validation order detects the impersonation at the signature step or the bundle-conformance step.
**Bundle replay across sessions.** *Threat:* an attacker captures a bundle from one session and replays it in another. *Mitigation:* the presentation signature is over the domain-separated payload "dacs-bundle-presentation:v1:" || bundle_hash, which the presenter generates fresh per session and which includes the session-binding nonce when presented in a session context (§6.3.2). Verifiers in a session context MUST validate the nonce; bundles missing the nonce in a session context MUST be rejected. Replay of an unverified bundle outside a session context is the equivalent of an unverified self-assertion and offers no advantage to the attacker.
**Catalog poisoning.** *Threat:* a catalog returns false listings or omits real ones. *Mitigation:* ListingSummary includes the anchor and contentHash; clients dereference and verify. A poisoned catalog causes UX confusion (a listing that does not exist on chain, or a missing listing) but cannot produce a verifiable false transaction.
**Claim-scheme spoofing.** *Threat:* a bundle includes a claim with a scheme the reader does not understand. *Mitigation:* unknown schemes MUST be treated as unverified. The reader cannot accept the claim as satisfying a required-and-verified bundle requirement.
**Identity-claim substitution between bundle presentation and Vet.** *Threat:* a counterparty presents bundle A in negotiation and bundle B at Vet time. *Mitigation:* the bundle hash is pinned into the session record at presentation time; DACS-2’s Vet stage operates on the pinned bundle. Substitution is detected by hash mismatch.
**Reading a listing after revocation.** *Threat:* a reader has cached a listing and engages without checking for revocation. *Mitigation:* readers MUST check the revocation marker before initiating a new session. Sessions already past commit-agreement are not invalidated by revocation, preserving in-flight obligations.
**Stale bundles in active sessions.** *Threat:* a session runs long enough that a verifiedBy reference becomes stale. *Mitigation:* DACS-2 specifies refresh semantics for required claims. For long-running entitlement sessions, listings SHOULD declare a refresh interval; v0.1 does not standardise this, deferring to DACS-2’s per-recipe defaults.
**Index integrity in .well-known.** *Threat:* a compromised web server publishes a falsified listings.json. *Mitigation:* the indexHash in the well-known block is signed only by the TLS certificate, not by the seller’s identity. Clients SHOULD prefer the index’s anchor (substrate-anchored copy) when available; in any case, individual listings MUST be dereferenced and validated independently.
**Private endpoints and impersonation.** *Threat:* seller.publicEndpoint claims a URL the seller does not control. *Mitigation:* this is a self-claim; readers MUST NOT treat the endpoint as authoritative for any cryptographic purpose. Endpoints are conveniences for off-chain reads, not trust anchors.
**Key lifecycle.** Every spec assumes a primary key exists per ClaimReference. Implementations MUST hold primary keys in a key-management system that does not retain plaintext at rest (HSM, TEE-backed enclave, or equivalent); support rotation (the relationship between a ClaimReference and its current key may change over time; the DACS-2 recipe for a scheme defines how key-current-ness is resolved); propagate revocation (publish a revocation marker for any listings the key signed, update bundle presentations to use a new key going forward); treat signatures produced by a key after its revocation timestamp as invalid for new sessions; sessions already past commit-agreement using the prior key remain bound (the obligation already exists).

## Chapter 7 — DACS-2: Vet

**Stage:** Vet (2nd of 5). **Status:** Draft (part of DACS v0.1). **Depends on:** SR-2 (required), SR-3 (required for consensus-backed-proxy and evm-rpc methods); composes with W3C VC, TLSNotary, zkTLS / Reclaim. **Used by:** DACS-1 (claim verification), DACS-3 (pre-negotiation gate), DACS-5 (audit references).

### 7.1 Abstract

DACS-2 specifies how a party’s claimed credentials are verified against authoritative sources during the Vet stage of a transaction. It defines:

- A **verification method registry** — a closed set of methods (verifiable-credential, tlsnotary, zktls, consensus-backed-proxy, oauth-attested, evm-rpc, domain-tls-control, self-signed), each with input/output shape, trust model, and substrate requirements.
- A **recipe registry** — a per-credential-type lookup table binding a DACS-1 claim scheme (e.g. lei, finra-crd, domain) to the method and parsing rules used to verify a claim of that scheme. Recipes are versioned and anchored.
- A **uniform VerifyResult shape** — the record the rest of the stack consumes, method-agnostic, anchored on the substrate, containing the decision, attestation reference, and structured data extracted from the authority’s response.
- A **composite verification record** — the document Vet produces, aggregating freshness checks, supplementary signals, and deal-specific claims into a single anchored artifact referenced by DACS-5.
- A **vet-credentials phase** — the DACS-2 phase type the orchestrator invokes; consumes the counterparty’s identity bundle and the listing’s bundle requirement, emits the composite verification record.

Vet does three different jobs and produces one output. The output is the composite verification record. The rest of the transaction — and a future auditor, regulator, or arbitrator — references it.

### 7.2 Motivation

The Vet stage answers two questions a party must resolve before progressing past vet-credentials: *is the counterparty’s identity bundle valid right now?* (a bundle assembled months ago may contain claims whose underlying registrations have lapsed, sanctions lists have updated, or certifications have expired); *is the bundle sufficient for this specific deal?* (the listing may require claims the bundle does not contain because they are deal-specific and were not pre-attested).
A naive design would treat Vet as a single one-shot credential check at session start. That fails for three reasons: **freshness** (existing standards produce attestations at issuance time; Vet must re-check at session start, against current authority state, and produce a current attestation that supersedes the stale one in the bundle); **supplementary signals** (reputation, completion history, dispute rates, and prior counterparty ratings inform whether to proceed even when every required claim is technically valid — these are not credentials in the formal sense but materially affect the decision); **deal-specific claims** (some claims exist only for this transaction — insurance binding for a particular shipment; clearance for a particular project — and are not pre-attested because they are not reused).
A second design failure: treating each verification method as its own protocol. Without a uniform consuming shape, every downstream component needs per-method handling. DACS-2 introduces the VerifyResult as the lingua franca: methods produce it, the rest of the stack consumes it.
A third design failure: forcing one method to handle all credentials. Authority-issued credentials in public registries (LEI, FINRA, SAM.gov, OFAC) do not cooperate with W3C VC issuance; their verification fits a consensus-backed proxy attestation pattern (SR-3). Private-data credentials (KYC tier, balance proofs) fit TLSNotary / zkTLS. Cooperative-issuer credentials fit W3C VC. The recipe registry routes each claim scheme to the appropriate method, and the rest of the stack stays method-agnostic.

### 7.3 Verification methods (v0.1 closed registry)

The v0.1 method set is closed. New methods are added in subsequent versions of DACS-2 by the governance process in chapter 11.

#### 7.3.1 Common contract

Every method MUST: (CM-1) accept inputs as specified in its sub-section; (CM-2) anchor its attestation via SR-2 at an address derived from the session id, claim scheme, and identifier (dacs2:{jobId}:{scheme}:{identifier}:v{recipeVersion} or substrate-equivalent); (CM-3) produce a VerifyResult conforming to §7.5; (CM-4) classify its outcome as exactly one of pass, fail, indeterminate, or error per the semantics in §7.5.1; (CM-5) set VerifyResult.method to its own kind.

#### 7.3.2 verifiable-credential

```
type VCMethodInput = {

  recipe: Recipe

  identifier: string                   // claim identifier (must match VC subject)

  presentation: VerifiablePresentation

  issuerAllowList?: ClaimReference[]

}
```

**Procedure.** Verifier parses the presentation; verifies the VC signature against the issuer key (resolved per VC method); if issuerAllowList is set, MUST reject if the VC issuer is not in the list; verifies the VC has not expired and is not revoked (via status list, if present); verifies the VC’s subject identifier matches the claim’s identifier canonically; **verifies the VerifiablePresentation's holder-binding proof — the presentation MUST be signed by the key controlling the credential subject (the holder), over a challenge that includes the session nonce (the bundle/DACS-3 `sessionNonce`); MUST reject if the holder proof is absent or does not verify** (without this, a verified VC captured from one party could be replayed by a non-holder, or re-presented across sessions — verifying the VC's issuer signature alone proves the credential is genuine, not that the presenter holds it); anchors the VC (or its hash, if VC is private) via SR-2; extracts structured data per recipe.parserRules; returns VerifyResult with pass if all steps succeed, fail on signature/expiry/revocation/holder-binding failures, and **error** on parser failures (a verifier-side failure to consume the presentation — never `fail`; consistent with PSP-2 and the §7.5.1 decision semantics, so it is retryable per VP-R1 rather than treated as a terminal authority answer). A parseable-but-inconclusive presentation is `indeterminate`. **Trust model:** issuer; W3C VC spec; key resolution method (e.g. did:web). **Substrate:** SR-2.

#### 7.3.3 tlsnotary

```
type TLSNotaryMethodInput = {

  recipe: Recipe

  identifier: string

  proof: TLSNotaryProof                // MPC-derived TLS session commitment + notary signature

  sessionTemplate?: string

}
```

**Procedure.** Validates the TLSNotary proof per the TLSNotary specification (current PSE rebuild); verifies the notary signature against a known notary public key registry; if sessionTemplate is set, verifies the proof targets that endpoint and protocol; anchors the proof commitment via SR-2; applies parser rules to any disclosed segments; returns VerifyResult per outcome. **Trust model:** TLS PKI; notary honesty; MPC computational assumptions. **Substrate:** SR-2.

#### 7.3.4 zktls

```
type ZKTLSMethodInput = {

  recipe: Recipe

  identifier: string

  provider: "reclaim" | "pluto" | string

  programId: string

  proof: ZKTLSProof

}
```

**Procedure.** Loads the verifier circuit for provider:programId; verifies the zk proof per the circuit’s verification algorithm; verifies any public inputs match expected values; anchors the proof + public-input hash via SR-2; applies parser rules to public-input disclosed data; returns VerifyResult per outcome. **Trust model:** zk soundness; provider’s circuit correctness; TLS PKI; proxy honesty (provider-dependent). **Substrate:** SR-2.

#### 7.3.5 consensus-backed-proxy

```
type ConsensusProxyMethodInput = {

  recipe: Recipe

  identifier: string

  endpoint: {

    method: "GET" | "POST"

    urlTemplate: string                // e.g. "https://api.gleif.org/api/v1/lei-records/{identifier}"

    headers?: Record<string, string>

    body?: string

  }

}
```

**Procedure.** Renders the URL by substituting {identifier} and other recipe parameters into urlTemplate; submits the fetch specification to the substrate’s SR-3 primitive (on Demos: dahr.startProxy({url, method, options})); the substrate returns the response body inline plus chain-anchored commitment hashes (responseHash, responseHeadersHash) via a one-tx web2Request. Anchors the commitment record via SR-2; applies parser rules to the response body; if recipe.negativeMatch is true (OFAC pattern): decision = "pass" when the parser finds no match, "fail" when a match is found; otherwise pass when the parser matches expected success criteria.
**Trust model in v0.1 — consensus-anchored hash commitment.** The substrate validator set collectively signs the on-chain transaction that asserts "we fetched URL X at time T and obtained a response with hash H." The full response body is **not** independently signed by the validator set in v0.1; the chain-level guarantee is "this hash came from this URL at this time," not "this body content is validator-attested." Verifiers consuming the body MUST verify the body’s hash matches the on-chain commitment.
**Trust caveats v0.1 implementations MUST surface to consumers.** (a) A validator-set majority that colludes can sign a commitment to a forged response; the body the consumer reads will hash to the committed value, so consumers cannot detect this from the commitment alone. (b) A single validator fetching the response and the rest signing the resulting hash is operationally indistinguishable from a full-fanout fetch under current SR-3 specs; recipes used for high-stakes verification SHOULD set multi-method alternatives (see §7.12). (c) The TLS connection between substrate validators and the authority is the trust floor for response authenticity at fetch time; an attacker who can MITM the authority’s TLS endpoint can cause all validators to commit to forged content.
**v0.2 strengthening (planned).** A future minor version is expected to specify a "validator-body-signed" mode in which each validator independently signs the response body bytes and the aggregate signature is anchored. When this mode ships, recipes for high-stakes schemes (lei, finra-crd, ofac-clear, sam-uei) SHOULD migrate to require it. v0.1 recipes that already declare alternatives are forward-compatible.
**Substrate:** SR-3 (proxy attestation primitive); SR-2 (anchoring).
**Note on the tlsn CCI context.** TLSNotary proofs are a native CCI context on Demos (cci-tlsn:<proof-hash>), validated by Demos’s GCR routines. When the proof is already registered as a cci-tlsn claim in the counterparty’s bundle, Vet treats it as a CCI-native verification (the tlsn GCR routine has already validated it) and does NOT re-run the external tlsnotary method. The external tlsnotary method applies only when an *unregistered* proof is presented at session time.

#### 7.3.6 oauth-attested

```
type OAuthAttestedMethodInput = {

  recipe: Recipe

  identifier: string

  provider: string                     // e.g. "google", "github"

  scopes: string[]

  maxTokenAgeSec: number               // recipe-required

  attestation: OAuthAttestationEnvelope

}
```

**Procedure.** Validates the attestation envelope’s signature; verifies the attestation references an OAuth flow that resolved to the claimed identifier (e.g. the sub claim from a Google ID token matches); verifies the granted scopes include those required by the recipe; **verifies the attestation is bound to this session — the attestation challenge/nonce MUST include the session nonce (the bundle/DACS-3 `sessionNonce`), and the verifier MUST reject an envelope whose nonce does not match the current session** — so a captured attestation envelope cannot be replayed by a non-holder or across sessions within `maxTokenAgeSec`, consistent with the §7.3.2 verifiable-credential holder-binding requirement (if the attestation service cannot carry a nonce, the recipe MUST document the residual replay risk); anchors the attestation via SR-2; returns VerifyResult. **Trust model:** OAuth provider; attestation service honesty; TLS PKI. **Substrate:** SR-2 (SR-3 if the attestation service is the substrate’s API Verification primitive).

#### 7.3.7 evm-rpc

```
type EVMRPCMethodInput = {

  recipe: Recipe

  identifier: string

  chainId: number

  contract: string                     // 0x address

  method: string                       // contract method name or selector

  args?: unknown[]                     // ABI-encoded arguments

}
```

**Procedure.** Submits a proxy-attested EVM call via SR-3 (typically wrapped as a JSON-RPC fetch); substrate validator set executes the call and signs the result; anchors the signed result via SR-2; decodes the return value per recipe parser rules; compares the decoded value to the claim’s identifier (e.g., owner address of an ERC-8004 token); returns VerifyResult. **Trust model:** substrate consensus; EVM chain finality. **Substrate:** SR-3; SR-2.

#### 7.3.8 domain-tls-control

```
type DomainTLSControlMethodInput = {

  recipe: Recipe

  identifier: string                   // the domain

  challengeType: "http-01" | "dns-01" | "tls-alpn-01"

  challenge: Challenge

  response: ChallengeResponse

}
```

**Procedure.** Validates the challenge/response per the ACME-style challenge specification; confirms response was retrievable from the claimed domain at the time of the challenge; anchors the challenge/response transcript via SR-2; returns VerifyResult (pass on valid response, fail on invalid, indeterminate on retrieval failure). **Trust model:** DNS / TLS PKI; ACME challenge integrity. **Substrate:** SR-2.

#### 7.3.9 self-signed

```
type SelfSignedMethodInput = {

  recipe: Recipe

  identifier: string                   // hex public key

  signature: string                    // signature over the claim assertion

  assertion: string                    // canonical bytes signed

}
```

**Procedure.** Validates the signature against the key in identifier; anchors the signed assertion via SR-2; returns VerifyResult with pass on valid signature, fail on invalid. This method provides minimal trust — it proves possession of the key, nothing more. Recipes targeting authority-issued schemes MUST NOT use self-signed. **Trust model:** cryptographic signature. **Substrate:** SR-2.

### 7.4 Recipe registry

A recipe binds a DACS-1 claim scheme to a verification method (or set of acceptable methods) plus parsing rules and defaults.

#### 7.4.1 Recipe schema

```
type Recipe = {

  recipeVersion: number                       // monotonic per scheme; starts at 1

  scheme: string

      failureObservation: string               // URL of authority change / observed response-format diff

    }

    deprecated?: boolean                       // true => MUST NOT start new sessions for required claims; see §7.4.4

    deprecationReason?: string                 // required when deprecated is true

  }

  signature: RecipeSignature                  // steward's signature (see §7.4.4)

}

type RecipeAvailability =

  | "live"            // authority endpoint reachable, attestation path runs end-to-end

  | "operator_gated"  // requires per-operator credential, key, or whitelisting

  | "closed_data"     // authority data not publicly accessible (e.g., paid feed, internal source)

  | "bilateral"       // requires per-relationship agreement between parties

  | "mocked"          // attestation path stubbed; not a production verification

  | "disabled"        // recipe present but the steward has marked it not-for-use

  | "failed"          // recipe's underlying authority is currently broken or unreachable

type VerificationMethod =

  | { kind: "verifiable-credential"; issuerAllowList?: ClaimReference[]; schemaUrl?: string }

  | { kind: "tlsnotary"; endpoint: string; sessionTemplate?: string }

  | { kind: "zktls"; provider: "reclaim" | "pluto" | string; programId: string }

  | { kind: "consensus-backed-proxy"; endpoint: { method: "GET" | "POST"; urlTemplate: string; headers?: Record<string, string>; body?: string } }

  | { kind: "oauth-attested"; provider: string; scopes: string[] }

  | { kind: "domain-tls-control"; challengeType: "http-01" | "dns-01" | "tls-alpn-01" }

  | { kind: "self-signed" }

type IndeterminatePredicate =

  | { jsonPath: string } | { selector: string } | { xPath: string } | { matcher: string }

type ParserSpec =

  | { format: "json"; successJsonPath: string; indeterminateOn?: IndeterminatePredicate[]; dataMap?: Record<string, string> }

  | { format: "html"; successSelector: string; indeterminateOn?: IndeterminatePredicate[]; dataMap?: Record<string, string> }

  | { format: "xml"; successXPath: string; indeterminateOn?: IndeterminatePredicate[]; dataMap?: Record<string, string> }

  | { format: "raw"; matcher: string; indeterminateOn?: IndeterminatePredicate[] }
```

**ParserSpec semantics (normative).** Given the attested response body, a verifier applies the recipe’s ParserSpec to produce a decision and an optional extracted-data map:

- (PSP-1) **successJsonPath / successSelector / successXPath / matcher** is the *match predicate*. For `json`, it is a JSONPath that MUST select at least one node for a match; for `html`, a CSS selector that MUST select at least one element; for `xml`, an XPath that MUST select at least one node; for `raw`, `matcher` is a regular expression (RE2 syntax, no backreferences) that MUST find at least one match in the body.
- (PSP-2) **Decision mapping.** If the body parses in the declared format AND the match predicate matches → the method’s positive outcome (`pass` for a positive-match scheme such as `lei`; `fail` for a negative-match scheme such as `ofac-clear`, where a match means "listed"; the recipe’s `negativeMatch: true` flag selects this inversion). If the body parses but the predicate does not match → the negative outcome (`fail`, or `pass` for a negative-match scheme). If the body does NOT parse in the declared format (malformed JSON/HTML/XML, parser exception) → `error` (verifier-side failure to obtain a decision), never `fail`. A response the authority returns to signal "no conclusive answer" (e.g. an explicit pending/partial-record marker the recipe lists in `indeterminateOn`) → `indeterminate`. The `indeterminateOn` predicates, when present, are evaluated against the parsed body BEFORE the match predicate; if any of them matches, the decision is `indeterminate` and the match predicate is not applied. Each predicate uses the expression kind appropriate to the declared `format` (`jsonPath` for `json`, `selector` for `html`, `xPath` for `xml`, `matcher` for `raw`). (PSP-5) **Negative-match completeness floor.** For a negative-match scheme whose decision rests on the *absence* of the identifier in a full-list download (e.g. `ofac-clear` over SDN.XML), the verifier MUST confirm the response is **complete** before returning the negative (`pass` = "not listed") outcome: it MUST check the received response against a completeness signal — the authority's declared record-count / list-size field, a documented end-of-list sentinel, or the HTTP `Content-Length` matching the received byte count — and MUST NOT return `pass` on a response that is truncated, partial, or whose completeness cannot be confirmed (→ `indeterminate`). A truncated-but-parseable SDN download in which the searched entity merely fell outside the received bytes would otherwise clear a sanctioned party; absence MUST be trusted only over a provably-complete response. PSP-5 applies to any `negativeMatch: true` recipe whose match predicate is "identifier not found in a downloaded list".
- (PSP-3) **dataMap** maps output field names to JSONPath/selector/XPath expressions evaluated against the same body; each resolved value is recorded in the VerifyResult’s extracted data for audit. A `dataMap` expression that resolves to nothing is recorded as null and MUST NOT by itself change the decision.
- (PSP-4) Parser evaluation MUST be deterministic and MUST NOT execute scripts, fetch sub-resources, or follow redirects embedded in the body.

*Worked example (`lei`, positive-match, GLEIF JSON-API):*

```
recipe.parserRules = {
  format: "json",
  successJsonPath: "$.data[0].attributes.lei",   // present iff GLEIF holds this LEI
  dataMap: {
    legalName:   "$.data[0].attributes.entity.legalName.name",
    status:      "$.data[0].attributes.entity.status",     // "ACTIVE" | "INACTIVE"
    jurisdiction:"$.data[0].attributes.entity.jurisdiction"
  }
}
// Body parses as JSON and successJsonPath selects a node  -> decision = pass
// Body parses as JSON but successJsonPath selects nothing  -> decision = fail
// Body is not valid JSON / GLEIF returns a 5xx HTML error  -> decision = error
// (extracted legalName/status/jurisdiction recorded in the VerifyResult — these are public GLEIF registry fields, exempt from §7.5 public-anchor minimisation; a privacy-sensitive recipe MUST instead reduce private fields to predicate outcomes)
```

#### 7.4.2 v0.1 recipe registry contents

The v0.1 registry contains one recipe per scheme registered in chapter 6. Each recipe is anchored via SR-2 at a steward-controlled address. Implementations MUST resolve recipes from the canonical addresses listed in the recipe-registry index document (dacs2:registry:v0.1). Default methods per scheme:

| Scheme | Default method | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| key | self-signed | Lowest trust; session continuity only |
| did | verifiable-credential (DID-bound) or self-signed (key-bound) | Per DID method |
| erc8004 | evm-rpc | Reads token owner |
| lei | consensus-backed-proxy against api.gleif.org/api/v1/lei-records/{identifier} | JSON parser; GLEIF JSON-API |
| finra-crd | consensus-backed-proxy against api.brokercheck.finra.org/search/individual/{identifier} | JSON; FINRA BrokerCheck JSON API (not the HTML site) |
| sam-uei | consensus-backed-proxy against api.sam.gov/entity-information/v3/entities?ueiSAM={identifier} | JSON; SAM.gov Entity API |
| ofac-clear | consensus-backed-proxy against sanctionslistservice.ofac.treas.gov/api/PublicationPreview/exports/SDN.XML | XML; full SDN List download; negativeMatch: true; parser searches for {identifier} entity |
| fedramp | consensus-backed-proxy against marketplace.fedramp.gov/api/v1/products/{identifier} | JSON; FedRAMP Marketplace API |
| naics | consensus-backed-proxy against api.census.gov/data/2017/cbp?get=NAICS2017&NAICS2017={identifier} | JSON; US Census API for NAICS validation |
| cmmc | verifiable-credential preferred; consensus-backed-proxy fallback against cmmcab.org public registry endpoint | CMMC AB publishes both VC issuance and a registry |
| domain | domain-tls-control | ACME-style |
| platform:<provider> | oauth-attested | Provider-specific |
| stripe-connect | oauth-attested (provider="stripe") | Stripe-specific scopes |

**Authority API stability.** The endpoints above are the canonical structured-data endpoints offered by each authority as of v0.1 publication. Authority APIs change; recipes MUST be re-anchored when endpoint URLs or response formats change materially. See §7.4.4 for the recipe-track governance that makes this operational.

#### 7.4.3 Recipe authoring and resolution

A conforming recipe author MUST: (RA-1) sign the recipe with the registry steward’s signing key over the domain-separated payload "dacs-recipe:v1:" || recipe_hash per chapter 7§7.7; (RA-2) anchor the recipe via SR-2 at the canonical address; (RA-3) specify recipeVersion as monotonically increasing per scheme; (RA-4) specify supersedes when replacing a prior recipe for the same scheme; (RA-5) provide at least one alternative method only if the scheme’s underlying authority supports multiple equivalent attestation paths.
A verifier MUST resolve a recipe by: reading the recipe-registry index from dacs2:registry:v0.1; looking up the entry for the claim’s scheme; fetching the recipe at the indicated anchor and verifying its content hash and domain-separated signature; if the matched `ClaimRequirement` pins a specific `recipeVersion` (§6.3.3), MUST use that version, otherwise MUST use the latest at session start, pinned into the session. This mirrors the rail-side `railVersion` pin (§9.3) and is the mechanism that protects an in-flight session from a steward shipping a recipe revision mid-session.

#### 7.4.4 Recipe-track lifecycle and current steward

**Recipes are operational artifacts on a different lifecycle than the DACS-2 standard itself.** Authority API endpoints change, response formats evolve, sanctions lists update, OAuth provider scopes shift. Treating every recipe revision as a DACS-2 minor version would force the standard onto an impractical release cadence. v0.1 separates the two tracks:

- **DACS-2 standard releases** (this chapter) version on a multi-year cadence. They define the method registry, the VerifyResult shape, the recipe schema, the aggregation algorithm, the phase contract.
- **DACS-2 recipe releases** (the recipe registry) version per-scheme on whatever cadence the underlying authority demands. Recipe revisions ship under the steward’s signing key and do not block on DACS-2 standard releases.

**Current steward (v0.1).** The DACS-2 recipe registry is currently maintained by **KyneSys Labs** as the v0.1 steward. This is a single-signer arrangement (phase PA-2 per the progressive-anchoring scheme below). Wider governance — working-group constitution, multi-signature schemes, sub-authority delegation by domain (sanctions lists, financial regulation, etc.) — is open work for v0.2+ and depends on the eventual constitution of a multi-party body. v0.1 implementations and consumers reason about the registry under single-steward semantics: one signing key, one anchoring authority, full transparency about both.
**Emergency recipe updates.** When an authority endpoint becomes unavailable or returns materially-incompatible data, the steward MAY publish an emergency recipe revision. Emergency revisions MUST: be signed normally; include an emergency: true field in the governance block; cite the failure observation (URL of authority change announcement, observed response format diff). Emergency revisions take effect at next session start; in-flight sessions continue against pinned recipeVersion.
**Recipe deprecation.** A recipe MAY be marked deprecated by publishing a new revision with deprecated: true and a deprecationReason. Verifiers MUST NOT initiate new sessions using deprecated recipes for required claims; in-flight sessions continue. A deprecated recipe with no replacement leaves the scheme un-verifiable; this is a v0.2 strengthening target for any scheme that hits this condition.
**Progressive anchoring phases.** Recipe anchoring proceeds through three phases. (PA-1) **Bootstrap phase.** Implementations MAY ship recipes as in-code constants or static configuration. Recipes in this phase MUST be marked anchoring: "in-code" and MUST NOT be presented as canonically anchored. (PA-2) **Single-steward phase.** The steward (currently KyneSys Labs) anchors recipes at the canonical address under a single signature, marked anchoring: "single-signer" and disclosing the steward’s identity. This is the current operating phase for v0.1. (PA-3) **Constituted phase.** If and when a multi-party governance body is constituted, recipes anchor under that body’s multi-signature scheme. Re-anchoring is append-only: prior single-signer recipeVersions MUST remain anchored, immutable, and independently re-verifiable under the steward key and content hash recorded during the single-signer phase (PA-2). The constituted body re-anchors prior recipes only as NEW recipeVersions under its multi-signature scheme; it MUST NOT mutate the signer or content hash of an already-published recipeVersion. This preserves the monotonic recipe-version pinning that §7.12 and §12.4 depend on: a VerifyResult pinned to a recipeVersion during PA-2 MUST continue to validate against the anchoring phase and signing key in force at pin time, not the current registry state. **(GOV-2)** Implementations MUST clearly disclose which phase they operate in; **(GOV-3)** consumers reading a VerifyResult MUST verify the recipe’s anchoring phase against their own trust requirements, evaluating each pinned recipeVersion against the phase recorded at the time it was anchored. GOV-3 is satisfiable from the data the protocol exposes: the consumer already resolves the recipe to verify a VerifyResult (§7.4.3), and the resolved Recipe carries `governance.anchoring` (`in-code` / `single-signer` / `multisig`, §7.4.1) — that field is the machine-readable anchoring phase GOV-3 checks.

#### 7.4.5 Recipe availability (normative)

Every Recipe MUST declare an availability value. The value names the recipe’s current operational status — what a verifier should actually expect when it tries to run this attestation path. The values are deliberately discrete and disjoint so consumers can compose them programmatically without flattening operational reality into a single boolean.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| live | Authority endpoint reachable today; the attestation path runs end-to-end against a public or near-public source. The normal operating state for a recipe consumers expect to "just work". |
| operator_gated | Recipe technically functions but requires per-operator setup before it can run: API credentials, IP whitelisting, paid subscription, registered relationship with the authority. Consumers can’t rely on it working without operator-side configuration. |
| closed_data | Authority data not publicly accessible — paid feed, proprietary database, regulator-only API. Recipe shape is defined for forward compatibility but the path cannot run from an open verifier. |
| bilateral | Recipe runs only between parties with a pre-existing bilateral agreement (custom trust anchor, shared secret, contracted attestation service). The shape exists so DACS-2 can describe such verifications uniformly; the recipe doesn’t function for general open-network use. |
| mocked | Attestation path is stubbed for development, testing, or honest-scope visibility. MUST NOT be presented as a production verification path. Implementations MUST surface this state to consumers (e.g., via the "dahr-stub:" prefix marker on attestations). |
| disabled | Recipe exists but the steward has marked it not-for-use, typically because a successor recipe exists or the underlying scheme is being retired. Verifiers MUST NOT initiate new sessions using disabled recipes; in-flight sessions continue. |
| failed | Recipe’s underlying authority is currently broken (endpoint down, response format changed in a way the parser cannot consume, certificate expired). Operationally indistinguishable from "live but unreachable" until the steward publishes an emergency revision or marks the recipe disabled. |

**Consumer obligations.** Verifiers MUST inspect availability before running the recipe. (RAV-1) A verifier MUST NOT silently treat operator_gated, closed_data, bilateral, mocked, disabled, or failed as live. (RAV-2) A verifier presented with a VerifyResult produced under a non-live availability MUST surface the availability value to the verifier’s consumer; a UI flattening seven states into "verified" / "not verified" without disclosing availability is non-conformant. (RAV-3) Aggregation under §7.7.1 treats VerifyResults from disabled, failed, or **mocked** recipes as decision = "error" regardless of the underlying authority response (the recipe is non-operational or a stub; any output is unreliable). In particular a `mocked` recipe MUST NOT satisfy a required claim — its `pass` is a test fixture, not a verification. (`operator_gated` / `closed_data` / `bilateral` differ: they can run validly once the relevant operator-side configuration is in place, so they are not forced to `error`.) (RAV-4) The availability of an alternative method does not override the availability of the default; consumers selecting an alternative MUST honour that alternative’s own availability.
**Steward obligations.** The current steward (§7.4.4 and §11.1.1) MUST keep availability values current. (RAV-5) Discovery that an authority endpoint has gone down requires either an emergency revision (§7.4.4) or a recipe revision setting availability to failed within a reasonable window. (RAV-6) Transitions from live → failed and failed → live are themselves recipe revisions and MUST be signed and anchored normally. (RAV-7) Availability is per-recipe-version, not per-scheme; a v3 recipe MAY be live while a v2 recipe is disabled for the same scheme.
**Why this is normative, not informative.** Earlier drafts carried this distinction in the front-matter production-mapping legend as informative iconography (🟢 / 🟡 / 🔵). That framing flattened distinct operational states (live, operator-gated, closed-data, mocked, etc.) into a single "wired" status and pushed disambiguation onto every implementer’s UI surface. Promoting availability to a normative field on the recipe itself moves the disambiguation into the protocol layer, where verifiers can reason about it programmatically and consumers can rely on conformant disclosure. This change was proposed by PATH-OS Labs (third-party reviewer; §11.3) and accepted into v0.1.

### 7.5 VerifyResult

The uniform record every method produces.

```
type VerifyResult = {

  resultVersion: "1"

  scheme: string                              // DACS-1 claim scheme

  identifier: string                          // canonical identifier verified

  recipeVersion: number

  method: VerificationMethod["kind"]

  decision: "pass" | "fail" | "indeterminate" | "error"

  reason: string                              // brief

  attestation: AttestationRef

  data?: Record<string, unknown>              // structured extraction per recipe.parserRules

  fetchedAt: number                           // unix ms when the authority was queried

  verifiedAt: number                          // unix ms when the result was finalised

  validUntil?: number

  signature: VerifyResultSignature

}

type AttestationRef = {

  anchor: { kind: "storage-program" | "ipfs" | "https"; locator: string }

  contentHash: string

  signer?: ClaimReference                     // for VC: issuer; for proxy: substrate validator-set claim (see below)

}
```

Canonical form is RFC 8785 JCS of the VerifyResult with the signature field omitted. The VerifyResult hash is sha256(canonical_form), hex-encoded. The signature is computed over the domain-separated payload per chapter 7§7.7:
signed_bytes := "dacs-verifyresult:v1:" || verifyresult_hash
**Validator-set claim references.** When AttestationRef.signer designates the producer of a consensus-backed-proxy or evm-rpc attestation, the ClaimReference MUST use the substrate-validator-set scheme: substrate-validator-set:<substrateId>:<epochOrSetId>. <substrateId> is a registered substrate identifier (v0.1 registry: "demos-mainnet", "demos-testnet"; future substrates added by the registry steward). <epochOrSetId> identifies the specific validator set that signed the attestation (Demos uses epoch numbers; substrates using rotating sets use whatever identifier the substrate exposes). Consumers MUST resolve the validator-set reference to the substrate’s published validator-set roster for that epoch and verify the attestation signature against the aggregate of those validators’ keys per the substrate’s consensus protocol. Substrates whose validator-set rosters are not publicly resolvable MUST NOT be used as the signer of a VerifyResult intended for cross-substrate consumption.
**Public-anchor data minimisation (normative).** A VerifyResult is anchored at a publicly-derivable address (§7.3.1 CM-2) in cleartext, so its `data` field is world-readable. Therefore `data` in a publicly-anchored VerifyResult MUST carry **only predicate outcomes** — the booleans / derived facts the recipe's match needs (e.g. `{ overEighteen: true }`, `{ sanctioned: false }`, `{ kycTier: "enhanced" }`) — and MUST NOT carry raw extracted **private** personal or financial fields (date of birth, account balance, document/government-ID numbers) or any value a privacy-preserving method was used specifically to avoid disclosing. This is load-bearing for privacy-preserving methods: a `tlsnotary` or `zktls` recipe exists precisely to prove a fact without revealing the underlying value, and copying that value into a cleartext public anchor would defeat the method. A recipe whose `parserRules` would extract such sensitive raw fields MUST reduce them to predicate outcomes before they enter an unencrypted anchored `data`. Fields that are **already public at the authority** — e.g. a public registry's published company name / jurisdiction, such as GLEIF LEI data — are NOT subject to this minimisation, since anchoring already-public registry data leaks nothing. (Carrying the raw fields is only permissible under the encrypted-to-parties anchoring mode that is roadmap work — see §12.1.) The exposure of `scheme`, `identifier`, and `decision` themselves is accepted by design per §12.1.

#### 7.5.1 Decision values and semantics

The four decision values are not interchangeable. Each has distinct semantics that govern retry behaviour, aggregation, and consumer interpretation:

- **pass** — verification ran cleanly and the authority confirmed the claim. The claim is verified.
- **fail** — verification ran cleanly and the authority’s response conclusively contradicts the claim (authority returned "no record found", returned a record that contradicts the asserted identifier, or returned an explicit denial). The claim is verified-false. fail is the authority’s decision; the verifier ran to completion.
- **indeterminate** — verification ran cleanly and the authority’s response was parseable but neither confirms nor contradicts the claim. Examples: authority returned a partial-match record; authority returned a status code that signals "result pending"; authority returned a record whose fields are insufficient to make the comparison the recipe requires. The authority gave its answer; the answer just wasn’t conclusive. indeterminate is the authority’s decision being non-binary.
- **error** — verification could not complete. Transport failure, SR-3 fetch timeout, malformed authority response that the parser cannot consume at all, parser exception, unexpected authority API change. The verifier never received a decision. error is the verifier’s failure to obtain an authority decision, not the authority’s decision to be ambiguous.

**Retry semantics.** (a) error MUST be treated as transient by default; the verifier MAY retry per recipe.retryClass (§7.6.1 below). (b) indeterminate MUST NOT be retried unless the recipe explicitly marks the method as retry-on-indeterminate (rare; reserved for authorities whose "pending" responses become conclusive on re-fetch). The authority’s indeterminate answer is the answer; re-asking does not change it. (c) pass and fail are terminal; no retry.
**Aggregation semantics.** A required claim with overall result error or indeterminate after retry budget exhaustion MUST cause vet-credentials to fail the phase. Consumers MUST NOT treat any of indeterminate, error, or fail as pass under any circumstances. Aggregation logic (§7.7.1) distinguishes the three non-pass outcomes in its failure reasons so downstream consumers (dispute, audit, debugging) can determine whether verification reached the authority at all.
**Why distinguish indeterminate from error.** Both produce non-pass outcomes, but the diagnostic value differs significantly. error means "we should try again or change verification path." indeterminate means "the authority answered, and the answer is not yes or no — escalate to a different authority or accept the ambiguity." Collapsing them loses information that consumers need.

#### 7.5.2 Attestation resolution algorithm

A consumer of a VerifyResult MUST validate the attestation by: fetching the anchor at AttestationRef.anchor.locator; checking integrity against AttestationRef.contentHash by the same procedure that produced it at anchor time (contentHash is the sha256 of the anchored content's canonical form, per the Content-hash definition) — for attestations that are canonical-JSON DACS documents, parsing the fetched content, recomputing the RFC 8785 canonical form, and comparing sha256(canonical_form) to AttestationRef.contentHash; for raw-byte attestations (e.g. a consensus-backed-proxy response body per §7.3.5, a tlsnotary proof, or an oauth-attested envelope), hashing the fetched bytes and comparing sha256(bytes) to AttestationRef.contentHash (mismatch MUST cause rejection in either case); for methods with signer, validating the attestation signature against the signer’s known key (mismatch MUST cause rejection); optionally parsing the attestation to independently re-derive the structured data (for high-stakes verifications).

### 7.6 Verification procedure

The verifier MUST execute each claim verification by: (1) resolving the recipe and pinning recipeVersion to the session record; (2) rendering method inputs by substituting the claim’s identifier into the method’s template; (3) invoking the method (calling the appropriate substrate primitive for SR-3 methods, or external service); (4) receiving the attestation (raw bytes or a reference if too large for inline transport); (5) anchoring the attestation via SR-2 at the derived address; (6) parsing the response by applying recipe.parserRules to extract structured data into VerifyResult.data; (7) applying parameters — checking the listing’s ClaimRequirement.parameters against extracted data (failure to match MUST set decision = "fail"); (8) signing and emitting the VerifyResult.

#### 7.6.1 Retry and caching semantics

(VP-R1) On decision = "error" with recipe.retryClass == "transient", the verifier MAY retry up to a recipe-defined retry budget (default: 3 attempts, exponential backoff). (VP-R2) A retry MUST produce a new attestation; reusing the prior attestation is not a retry. (VP-R3) On recipe.retryClass == "permanent", the verifier MUST NOT retry within the same session; the failure is final for that session. (VP-R4) On decision = "indeterminate", the verifier MUST NOT retry unless recipe.retryOnIndeterminate is explicitly true (default false). The authority’s indeterminate answer is itself the answer; re-asking does not change it. The retryOnIndeterminate flag is reserved for authorities whose "pending" or "queued" responses become conclusive on re-fetch.
(VP-C1) A VerifyResult for (scheme, identifier, recipeVersion) MAY be reused within the recipe’s defaultMaxAgeSec (or the result’s validUntil). (VP-C2) Reuse MUST update the consuming session’s record to reference the cached VerifyResult. (VP-C3) Reuse MUST NOT bypass freshness requirements declared by the listing’s ClaimRequirement.maxAge.

### 7.7 Composite verification record

The document the vet-credentials phase produces.

```
type CompositeVerificationRecord = {

  recordVersion: "1"

  jobId: string                               // DACS-5 session id

  evaluatedParty: ClaimReference              // counterparty's primary identity claim

  bundleHash: string                          // sha256 of the IdentityBundle this Vet ran against

  requirementHash: string                     // sha256 of the listing's BundleRequirement

  freshness: VerifyResultRef[]                // re-verifications of pre-attested claims

  supplementary: SupplementarySignal[]

  dealSpecific: VerifyResultRef[]

  overallDecision: "pass" | "fail" | "indeterminate" | "error"

  generatedAt: number

  signature: ComponentSignature               // signed by the verifier

}

type VerifyResultRef = {

  anchor: { kind: "storage-program" | "ipfs" | "https"; locator: string }

  contentHash: string

  recipeVersion: number

}

type SupplementarySignal = {

  source: "dacs-5" | "cci-nomis" | "cci-ethos" | "cci-humanpassport" | "external" | string

  signalType: string                          // e.g. "completion-rate", "dispute-rate", "rating-avg"

  value: number | string

  observedAt: number

  attestation?: AttestationRef                // required for "external" sources

}
```

CCI-native reputation signals (cci-nomis, cci-ethos, cci-humanpassport) are first-class supplementary signal sources: they are read from the counterparty’s CCI without needing a separate attestation, because the underlying CCI context’s GCR routine has already validated them.

#### 7.7.1 Aggregation algorithm

A verifier MUST compute overallDecision per the following algorithm. The algorithm distinguishes four cases for each required claim: passing, indeterminate (authority answered ambiguously), errored (verifier could not reach the authority), and failing/absent. Precedence among non-pass outcomes is failures > errors > indeterminates so that the strongest evidence dominates aggregation.

```
aggregate(record, requirement):

  failures := []

  errors := []

  indeterminates := []

  # All required claims must have a passing VerifyResult

  for cr in requirement.required:

    classify_required(record, cr, failures, errors, indeterminates)

  # oneOf groups must each contain at least one passing

  for group in requirement.oneOf:

    if not any(find_passing(record, cr.scheme) for cr in group):

      # Distinguish error vs indeterminate vs hard miss for the group
      # (error before indeterminate, matching the global precedence below)

      if any(find_error(record, cr.scheme) for cr in group):

        errors.append("oneOf group: at least one claim errored")

      else if any(find_indeterminate(record, cr.scheme) for cr in group):

        indeterminates.append("oneOf group: at least one claim indeterminate")

      else:

        failures.append("oneOf group: no claim satisfied")

  # Precedence: failures > errors > indeterminates

  if failures: return "fail", failures

  if errors: return "error", errors

  if indeterminates: return "indeterminate", indeterminates

  return "pass", []

classify_required(record, cr, failures, errors, indeterminates):

  results := find_all_results(record, cr.scheme)   // freshness ++ dealSpecific (supplementary signals NOT included); find_passing/find_error/find_indeterminate(record, scheme) each scan find_all_results(record, scheme) for a result with the named decision

  if results is empty:

    failures.append("required not present: " + cr.scheme)

    return

  if any(r.decision == "pass" for r in results):

    return  // claim satisfied

  if any(r.decision == "fail" for r in results):

    failures.append("required failing: " + cr.scheme)

    return

  if any(r.decision == "error" for r in results):

    errors.append("required errored: " + cr.scheme)

    return

  // remaining results are "indeterminate"

  indeterminates.append("required indeterminate: " + cr.scheme)
```

Supplementary signals MUST NOT change overallDecision from pass to fail automatically; they are informational. A listing MAY declare in terms that specific signals are gating (e.g. minimum reputation score); when so declared, the gating check is treated as a deal-specific claim and runs through the same aggregation. The four classifications carry distinct diagnostic value: "required not present" (no VerifyResult at all), "required failing" (authority said no), "required indeterminate" (authority answered ambiguously), "required errored" (verifier could not reach authority). Consumers debugging or auditing a failed session can read the failure reasons to determine which class the failure belongs to.

#### 7.7.2 Anchoring and signature

The composite record MUST be anchored via SR-2 at address dacs2:composite:{jobId}:{evaluatedParty} (or substrate equivalent). The anchor reference is recorded in the DACS-5 session record. The composite record’s signature MUST be produced by the verifier (the party running Vet on the counterparty) over the domain-separated payload per chapter 7§7.7:
signed_bytes := "dacs-composite:v1:" || composite_hash
In v0.1, the composite record carries a single verifier signature. Multi-party composition (e.g., two-sided independent Vet records cross-referenced into one) is deferred to v2.

### 7.8 The vet-credentials phase

```
type VetCredentialsInput = {

  jobId: string

  actor: "buyer" | "seller"

  bundleToVet: IdentityBundle

  requirement: BundleRequirement

  verifierIdentity: IdentityBundle

  sessionContext: SessionContext

  recipeRegistryVersion: number

  attempt: number

}

type VetCredentialsOutput = PhaseHandlerResult & {

  contextDelta: {

    "vet-credentials": {

      compositeRecord: AttestationRef

      overallDecision: "pass" | "fail" | "indeterminate" | "error"

    }

  }

}
```

#### 7.8.1 Phase contract

The orchestrator MUST: (VPC-1) invoke vet-credentials after a successful Identify stage and before any Negotiate phase requiring a verified bundle; (VPC-2) invoke vet-credentials once per party — once with the buyer’s bundle (against listing-side requirements on buyers) and once with the seller’s bundle (against buyer-side requirements on sellers), each invocation producing its own CompositeVerificationRecord (the input carries a single `bundleToVet` + `actor`) — before Negotiate; (VPC-3) anchor the composite record before returning the phase result; (VPC-4) on overallDecision != "pass" (after permitted retries), MUST fail the phase with errorClass derived from the overall decision: "fail" → counterparty errorClass; "indeterminate" or "error" → permanent. By the point VPC-4 is evaluated the retry budget is already exhausted (`indeterminate` MUST NOT be retried at all per VP-R4; `error` is retried only while budget remains), so the *phase-overall* outcome is terminal: the `transient` class applies to in-flight retries, never to the phase-fail result. This matches the §7.8.2 cause table (`indeterminate`/`error` after retry-budget exhaustion → permanent).

#### 7.8.2 Error classification and idempotency

| Error class | Cause | Retry? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| transient | Substrate temporarily unavailable; authority HTTP 5xx | Yes (per VP-R1) |
| permanent | Bundle malformed/unparseable; or `indeterminate`/`error` after retry-budget exhaustion (per recipe.retryClass) | No |
| counterparty | Counterparty fails to present a required claim, OR a required claim returns `decision=fail` (the authority conclusively rejected the counterparty's claim) | No (Vet fails; counterparty marked at-fault) |
| substrate | SR-2 or SR-3 unavailable for sustained period | Pause session per DACS-5 |

**VPC-4 is the authoritative cause→class mapping; this table enumerates causes consistent with it, not an independent rule.** A required claim returning `decision=fail` maps to **counterparty** (per VPC-4: `"fail" → counterparty`) — it is the counterparty's claim that the authority rejected, so it is never `permanent`. `permanent` is reserved for structural failures (a malformed/unparseable bundle) and for `indeterminate`/`error` outcomes that exhaust their retry budget. Because the class is fully determined by the decision/cause, an orchestrator has no discretion to steer a self-caused `fail` away from the counterparty fault bucket (§10.5.1).

Re-running vet-credentials with the same inputs MUST produce the same composite-record content modulo the volatile fields refreshed against current state — `generatedAt`, each VerifyResult's `fetchedAt`/`verifiedAt`, and supplementary signals' `observedAt`/`value`. The orchestrator MUST NOT double-anchor; the reuse/no-change test is over the **stable** content (the freshness/deal-specific VerifyResultRefs + decisions, excluding those volatile timestamp/value fields), so an unchanged authority state reuses the existing anchor.

### 7.9 Conformance summary

| Role | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Method implementer | CM-1 through CM-5 |
| Recipe author | RA-1 through RA-5 |
| Recipe-availability consumer | RAV-1 through RAV-4 |
| Recipe steward (availability) | RAV-5 through RAV-7 |
| Verifier (orchestrator) | VP-R1 through VP-R4; VP-C1 through VP-C3; VPC-1 through VPC-4 |
| VerifyResult consumer | §7.5.2 attestation resolution; recipe-version pinning |
| Composite record reader | §7.7.1 aggregation; signature validation |

### 7.10 Rationale

**Method-pluggable registry vs single method.** A single-method design would force every credential through one verification approach. No single approach fits every credential: cooperative-issuer credentials want W3C VC; private-data credentials want zkTLS; public-registry credentials want consensus-backed proxy attestation. The pluggable registry routes by credential type, and the rest of the stack consumes a uniform VerifyResult.
**Closed v0.1 method set vs open from day one.** An open method registry from v0.1 makes conformance untestable: a verifier could declare an arbitrary "my-custom-method" and produce results the rest of the stack cannot validate. v0.1 ships eight methods covering the established attestation patterns. New methods are added through the steward’s acceptance process, the same way new schemes are added in DACS-1.
**Recipe-per-scheme vs general-purpose verification protocol.** A general-purpose protocol (e.g., a single configurable HTTP-fetch endpoint per credential) would lose the structured parser rules, the success-criterion semantics, and the negative-match pattern that recipes encode. Recipes are small and per-scheme; they capture the messy reality of each authority’s response format.
**Composite record vs separate per-claim records.** The rest of the stack needs to reference *one* artifact for Vet, not N. Separate per-claim records would force every downstream consumer to walk a list and compose. The composite record does the composition once, signs once, anchors once.
**SR-3 dependency for consensus-backed-proxy.** A substrate-agnostic version would require trusting a single proxy (Reclaim-style) or running MPC (TLSNotary-style). Both are valid options — and are present as separate methods in the registry — but they have higher per-verification cost and lower throughput. For high-volume public-registry verification (the bulk of institutional Vet workload), consensus-backed proxy at chain rate is the right tool. The substrate dependency is stated explicitly and is opt-in per recipe.
**Single-verifier signature on composite record vs multi-party signed.** In a typical transaction, the buyer runs Vet on the seller and vice versa; each produces its own composite record. v0.1 carries one signature per record. Multi-party composition (a single record signed by both sides, attesting to mutual Vet) is more complex and is deferred.
**Reputation as a supplementary signal vs a hard credential gate.** Reputation is not a credential — it has no authoritative source — and treating it as one would let a low-reputation counterparty fail Vet outright, eliminating any ability for new sellers to enter the market. As a supplementary signal, reputation is surfaced to the verifier (and to a listing’s optional gating) but does not by default block engagement.

### 7.11 Backwards compatibility

**W3C Verifiable Credentials.** A DACS-2 recipe for any scheme MAY declare verifiable-credential as its default method. The DACS-2 verifier accepts a W3C VP (Verifiable Presentation) containing the VC; verification follows W3C VC data model 2.0. Recipe authors SHOULD set issuerAllowList for schemes where only specific issuers should be trusted (e.g., a recipe for kyc-tier would allow-list specific KYC providers).
**TLSNotary.** A DACS-2 recipe MAY declare tlsnotary as its method. The proof envelope is a TLSNotary commitment; the notary signature is anchored as part of AttestationRef. Compatible with TLSNotary versions implementing the PSE 2024 rebuild and later.
**zkTLS / Reclaim Protocol / Pluto.** A DACS-2 recipe MAY declare zktls and select a provider; the provider’s circuit/verification program id determines the verifier’s check. Compatible with Reclaim Protocol’s production verifier contracts and any equivalent zkTLS provider that ships a circuit description.
**ERC-8004.** Recipes for the erc8004 scheme use the evm-rpc method to read token ownership via proxy-attested EVM call. DACS-2 results may additionally be published to the ERC-8004 reputation / validation registries via DACS-5; DACS-2 itself does not write there.
**ACME / Let’s Encrypt domain-control challenges.** The domain-tls-control method follows ACME’s challenge/response patterns (RFC 8555). Implementations MAY reuse existing ACME libraries.

### 7.12 Security considerations

**Method substitution.** *Threat:* a verifier uses a weaker method than the recipe declares. *Mitigation:* the VerifyResult.method field MUST be the method actually executed; consumers compare to the recipe’s defaultMethod and alternatives and reject results that used an unaccepted method. Recipes SHOULD list only equivalent alternatives.
**Recipe poisoning.** *Threat:* a compromised recipe registry returns incorrect parsing rules, causing every verification using that recipe to mis-classify outcomes. *Mitigation:* recipes are signed by the registry steward (currently KyneSys Labs, per §7.4.4); consumers MUST verify the signature. Recipe recipeVersion is monotonic and pinned per session; an attacker compromising the registry tomorrow does not retroactively change recipes used in already-pinned sessions. Steward-key compromise is the principal residual risk under the current PA-2 single-signer phase; multi-signature governance (PA-3) is the v0.2+ mitigation pathway.
**Replay of VerifyResult across sessions.** *Threat:* a verifier reuses a stale VerifyResult from a different session or a different counterparty. *Mitigation:* the VerifyResult.identifier MUST match the claim under verification canonically; consumers verify the match. The composite record’s bundleHash and evaluatedParty bind the verification to a specific bundle. Cross-session reuse within validUntil is explicitly permitted and is safe because the result still verifies against the same identifier.
**TOCTOU: authority state changes between fetch and use.** *Threat:* a counterparty’s authority status changes between Vet and the actual transaction execution. *Mitigation:* listings handling time-sensitive flows SHOULD set ClaimRequirement.maxAge aggressively (e.g., 60 seconds for OFAC clearance on a real-money trade). Sessions with long latency between Vet and Settle SHOULD re-run Vet at Settle time for the most stake-sensitive claims.
**Substrate validator capture (SR-3).** *Threat:* a majority-corrupt substrate validator set forges responses, causing consensus-backed-proxy and evm-rpc methods to attest to false facts. *Mitigation:* the substrate’s consensus model is the trust floor; DACS-2 inherits whatever security properties the substrate provides. For credentials where this risk is unacceptable, recipes SHOULD declare **alternative independent methods** (the recipe `alternatives` mechanism, §7.4) so a high-stakes claim can additionally be verified by an independent method (e.g. tlsnotary or zktls) rather than relying on consensus-backed-proxy alone. Note the scope of what v0.1 composes: **cross-claim AND** — a listing requiring several distinct verified claims, all of which MUST pass — is already enforced (§6.3.3 `BundleRequirement.required`, "all MUST be satisfied"), and is how a real vet stacks GLEIF + OFAC + reputation. What v0.1 does **not** define is a single-claim multi-method-**AND** combinator (verifying the *same* claim by two methods that MUST both pass): §7.7.1 aggregation composes multiple VerifyResults for one claim but has no `requireAll` semantics, and no such flag is defined on the Recipe. Single-claim multi-method-AND is a roadmap item; v0.1 high-stakes recipes use alternatives (additional independent methods) plus cross-claim required-set AND.
**W3C VC issuer compromise.** *Threat:* the signing key of a VC issuer is compromised, causing all VCs signed by that issuer to be untrustworthy. *Mitigation:* recipes SHOULD set issuerAllowList and check issuer revocation registries (where available, e.g., W3C VC Status List 2021). Issuers SHOULD rotate keys regularly. Consumers of historical VerifyResults SHOULD check whether the issuer was known-compromised at the time of verification.
**TLSNotary notary collusion.** *Threat:* the notary colludes with the prover to attest to false TLS sessions. *Mitigation:* TLSNotary’s MPC ensures the notary cannot see plaintext but does require honesty about the commitment. Recipes using tlsnotary SHOULD specify a known-good notary public key in the recipe; multi-notary patterns are a future extension.
**zkTLS proxy compromise.** *Threat:* the zkTLS provider’s proxy attests to false TLS responses. *Mitigation:* recipes select specific providers and program IDs. Compromise of a provider’s proxy invalidates all results from that provider; consumers SHOULD treat results from a known-compromised provider as invalid retroactively.
**Supplementary signal poisoning.** *Threat:* false reputation data is injected (e.g. a Sybil network creating fake successful completions). *Mitigation:* DACS-5 specifies the reputation derivation; supplementary signals from DACS-5 inherit DACS-5’s anti-Sybil properties. Supplementary signals from external sources MUST carry an AttestationRef; consumers MAY decline to weigh signals from sources they do not trust.
**Identifier canonicalisation gaps.** *Threat:* the same logical identifier in two different forms produces two different VerifyResult lookups or two different reputation keys, allowing an attacker to substitute or to split/launder reputation. *Mitigation:* the canonical-form rules CF-1 (NFC, §7.2), CF-2 (ClaimReference canonical byte form), and CF-3 (canonical identity = canonical scheme + identifier, parameters excluded), plus any per-scheme identifier rule, are normative. Verifiers MUST canonicalise per CF-1/CF-2 before issuing a VerifyResult, and consumers MUST compare per the CF-3 identity before lookup, reputation keying, or the §7.3.2 replay check.
**Composite record forgery.** *Threat:* an attacker constructs a composite record with overallDecision = "pass" and false VerifyResultRefs. *Mitigation:* the composite record is signed by the verifier; consumers verify the signature. The bundleHash and requirementHash fields bind the record to specific inputs; consumers verify these against the inputs they actually used. Each VerifyResultRef MUST be dereferenced and content-hash-validated before the composite record is accepted.
**Indeterminate-decision exploitation.** *Threat:* an attacker arranges for a required claim’s verification to fail in a way that returns indeterminate rather than fail, hoping consumers treat the result as pass. *Mitigation:* indeterminate is not pass. The aggregation algorithm treats indeterminate in a required position as overall indeterminate, which MUST fail the phase.

## Chapter 8 — DACS-3: Negotiate

**Stage:** Negotiate (3rd of 5). **Status:** Draft (part of DACS v0.1). **Depends on:** SR-2 (required for public commitments), SR-4 (required for genuinely private negotiation patterns); references DACS-1 listings and DACS-2 verified bundles. **Used by:** DACS-4 (pricing + rail input to settlement), DACS-5 (agreement reference in session bundle).

### 8.1 Abstract

DACS-3 specifies how transacting parties arrive at agreed terms and bind themselves cryptographically to the outcome. It defines:

- A **negotiation channel model** — the abstract requirements for a private coordination surface keyed to the participants’ identities, with the public chain seeing only commitments. Realised in v0.1 by SR-4; substrates without SR-4 can host only negotiate-fixed-price.
- A **closed set of negotiation patterns** as DACS-3 phase types: negotiate-fixed-price (acceptance), negotiate-rfq (open-ended offer/counter exchange with bounded turns), negotiate-sealed-envelope (commit-then-reveal sealed-bid procurement). Each is a phase with a uniform input/output contract.
- An **agreement document schema** — the canonical, signed JSON document the parties produce as the output of any negotiation pattern. Carries the final terms, deliverable reference, deadlines, and signatures from all parties.
- A **commitment phase** (commit-agreement) — the DACS-3 phase that anchors the agreement hash on the public chain, producing the binding artifact every downstream stage references.

Negotiation contents stay between the participants. The public chain receives only what is needed to bind them to the outcome.

### 8.2 Motivation

Negotiation is the stage in which commerce most consistently breaks open standards. Identity, payment, and capability discovery can run on public infrastructure with little privacy cost for their *contents* — though the durable identities they bind remain visible at the public audit layer, an accepted accountability-over-privacy tradeoff (§12.1). Pricing, term-sheet drafts, sealed-bid submissions, and RFQ counter-offers cannot — they involve material non-public information, competitive pricing, or simply discussions whose contents would harm the participants if exposed.
A buyer agent today can issue an RFQ to three sellers via public channels, but the public visibility of the request, the counters, and the timing telegraphs market information that institutional desks specifically pay to keep private. Sealed-bid government procurement cannot run on a public mempool. Pre-trade negotiation in regulated markets is bound by MNPI rules that public-chain visibility violates.
DACS-3 closes this gap by separating two concerns that have historically been fused:

- **Negotiation content** lives in a private channel between participants. The channel’s membership is bound to the same identities that hold value on the public chain — so signatures inside the channel are equivalent to public-chain signatures — but the contents never become public.
- **Commitment** lives on the public chain. At the end of negotiation, a single hash of the final agreement is anchored. Anyone with access to the public chain can verify that a binding agreement exists between the named parties at a known timestamp; they cannot read its contents without channel access.

This separation is what makes institutional and regulated flows possible on a public-permissionless substrate. It is also what most distinguishes DACS from existing open standards: payment authorisation standards (AP2, x402), identity registries (ERC-8004), and credential attestation standards (W3C VC, zkTLS) all assume public negotiation or no negotiation. DACS-3 takes the negotiation primitive seriously.
A third concern: not every transaction needs private negotiation. A $0.01 API micropayment with a fixed price has nothing to negotiate; the listing’s posted terms are the agreement, and "acceptance is the negotiation." DACS-3 makes this case trivial via negotiate-fixed-price, which requires only SR-2 (anchoring) and works on any substrate. The substrate-locked patterns (negotiate-rfq, negotiate-sealed-envelope) are opt-in per listing.

### 8.3 Negotiation channel model

A negotiation channel is a coordination surface with the following properties.

#### 8.3.1 Required properties

(CH-1) **Identity-keyed membership.** The channel’s member set is a list of ClaimReferences, **fixed for the channel's lifetime in v0.1**. Each member’s primary claim MUST appear in their verified DACS-1 bundle. The member set is established by the §8.3.2 binding-proof flow before negotiation begins and MUST NOT change mid-channel. Dynamic membership (mid-negotiation add/remove governed by an admission policy) is reserved for a future version: the `membership-change` message type and an `admissionPolicy` schema are deliberately **not** defined in v0.1, and `membership-change` is correspondingly absent from the v0.1 `ChannelMessage.type` set.
(CH-2) **Confidentiality.** Non-members MUST NOT be able to read channel contents. The public chain MUST see only commitments (envelope commitments, agreement hash) and never raw offer/counter/reveal payloads.
(CH-3) **Authenticity.** Every message in the channel MUST be signed by its author’s primary key (the key associated with the author’s primary claim). Verifiers MUST be able to validate signatures using the same keys used in DACS-2 verification.
(CH-4) **Liveness.** The channel MUST deliver messages to all members within a bounded delay. Members MUST be able to detect channel-level failure (partition, censorship by the channel operator) and abort.
(CH-5) **Termination.** The channel MUST produce a terminal state. Terminal states are: (a) a signed AgreementDocument; (b) an abort signed by any party; (c) timeout. The terminal state is referenced by commit-agreement (if agreement) or recorded as a failed Negotiate stage (otherwise).
(CH-6) **Per-session channelId uniqueness.** The substrate MUST derive a per-session-unique `channelId`, and an orchestrator MUST reject a session that reuses a `channelId` from a prior session. Without this the cross-session offer-replay defence (§8.3.3 envelope `channelId` + monotonic `sequence`) is vacuous — a reused `channelId` would let a session-A offer verify in session B. The threat and replay analysis are detailed in §8.12.

#### 8.3.2 SR-4 realisation

On Demos, L2PS (Layer-2 Privacy Subnets) is the SR-4 implementation. Channel sessions are subnets; messages stay between subnet members; the public chain stores only commitment hashes and the final agreement hash (as Storage Programs). For v0.1, subnet membership MUST be bindable to the participants’ CCI primary claims so that channel-message signatures verify against the same key that holds value on-chain, and the commit-agreement anchor’s parties match the channel members. Until CCI-keyed membership ships, implementations MAY use a binding-proof step: each participant signs an "L2PS subnet X membership = CCI Y" attestation with their CCI primary key, anchored as a Storage Program before negotiation begins.
Other substrates MAY implement SR-4 via TEE-based confidential channels, zk-based privacy circuits, or permissioned-overlay networks bound to public-chain identity, provided they satisfy CH-1 through CH-6. DACS-3 does not standardise the wire protocol or the cryptographic envelope — those are SR-4 implementation choices — but does standardise the messages’ semantic shape.

#### 8.3.3 Message envelope (substrate-independent)

```
type ChannelMessage = {

  channelId: string                    // substrate-derived; opaque to DACS-3; MUST be unique per session (see CH-6)

  sequence: number                     // monotonic per channel, starts at 1

  sender: ClaimReference               // author's primary claim

  sentAt: number                       // unix ms

  type: "offer" | "counter" | "accept" | "reject"

       | "sealed-envelope-commit" | "sealed-envelope-reveal"

       | "abort"

  body: unknown                        // type-specific. Sealed-envelope commit/reveal bodies are defined in §8.4.3; RFQ offer/counter/accept/reject bodies are implementation-defined (the authoritative agreed terms live only in the signed AgreementDocument, not the channel body)

  refs?: { repliesTo?: number }

  signature: ChannelMessageSignature   // see below

}
```

The envelope’s canonical form is the RFC 8785 JCS serialisation with the signature field omitted. The envelope hash is sha256(canonical_form), hex-encoded. The signature is computed over the domain-separated payload per chapter 7§7.7:
signed_bytes := "dacs-channelmsg:v1:" || envelope_hash
Implementations MAY add transport-level fields (routing, framing) outside the signed envelope; signed envelope contents MUST NOT change between sender and receiver.

#### 8.3.4 Channel failure detection and abort

A member MUST treat the channel as failed when: a message they sent is not acknowledged by a quorum of members within the channel’s liveness bound; a member they expect to respond does not respond within a per-pattern timeout; they observe contradictory views of the channel state from different sources (channel-operator forking).
On detected failure, the member MAY send an abort message (best-effort), abandon the channel, and record the failure in the session record (DACS-5) with classification counterparty or substrate as appropriate. An abort terminates the channel and the Negotiate phase. The abort message’s signed envelope MAY be anchored via SR-2 as an audit artifact. The phase returns PhaseHandlerResult with ok: false and an error class.

### 8.4 Negotiation patterns

The v0.1 closed set. Each is a DACS-3 phase type with a phase-handler contract.

#### 8.4.1 negotiate-fixed-price

Acceptance of the listing’s posted terms. No private channel required.

```
type NegotiateFixedPriceInput = {

  jobId: string

  listingHash: string                  // pinned listing's content hash

  listingRef: { listingId: string; version: number }

  buyerBundle: IdentityBundle          // post-Vet

  sellerBundle: IdentityBundle         // post-Vet

  buyerVetRef: AttestationRef          // from DACS-2

  sellerVetRef: AttestationRef         // from DACS-2

  sessionContext: SessionContext

}

type NegotiateFixedPriceOutput = PhaseHandlerResult & {

  contextDelta?: {   // present only on ok:true; a failed phase returns a bare PhaseHandlerResult (no agreement)

    "negotiate-fixed-price": {

      agreementHash: string

      agreementRef: AttestationRef

    }

  }

}
```

**Procedure.** The orchestrator (or buyer agent, depending on actor) MUST: construct an AgreementDocument with derivedFromPattern: "fixed-price", copying terms directly from the listing’s pricing, acceptedRails (using the buyer’s selected rail), deliverable, and deadline (computed as now + listing.terms.deadlineSecAfterCommit); collect buyer signature; collect seller co-signature; anchor the agreement document via SR-2; return agreementHash and agreementRef.
**Seller-side auto-accept (optional)**
A listing MAY declare terms.acceptanceModel: "auto-accept", in which case the seller pre-issues a **template acceptance commitment** alongside the listing rather than a per-session signature. The mechanism:

- The seller publishes, at listing-anchor time, a separate AutoAcceptCommitment record: { listingRef, listingContentHash, acceptanceModel: "auto-accept", validUntil, sellerSignature } where sellerSignature is the seller’s signature over the domain-separated payload "dacs-auto-accept-commitment:v1:" || sha256(canonical(commitment)). This commits the seller to auto-accepting any buyer signature against the listed terms within validUntil.
- At orchestrator time, the orchestrator: (1) verifies the AutoAcceptCommitment is anchored, unrevoked, and still valid — checking `validUntil` provisionally against the current clock at signing time (an already-expired commitment MUST NOT produce an instance signature), then authoritatively re-checking `committedAt ≤ validUntil` against the anchored commitment timestamp (`committedAt`, §8.5.2) at commit-agreement, per the §8.5.2 ordering note; the per-session `committedAt` does not exist until the commitment is anchored, so it cannot gate the signature pre-anchor; (2) constructs the per-session AgreementDocument with derivedFromPattern: "fixed-price"; (3) computes the agreement hash; (4) constructs an auto-accept seller signature: an Ed25519 signature by the seller’s primary key over "dacs-auto-accept-instance:v1:" || agreementHash || autoAcceptCommitmentHash. This instance signature is NOT pre-issued — it MUST be produced live by the seller’s keyholder or by an authorised auto-signer the seller has explicitly delegated to. The pre-issued AutoAcceptCommitment authorises the auto-signer to produce instance signatures within its scope.

Listings using auto-accept MUST publish the AutoAcceptCommitment alongside the listing, and the buyer’s orchestrator MUST verify the commitment before relying on auto-accept. A pre-issued per-instance signature (signing a placeholder agreement hash) MUST NOT be used; the per-instance signature binds to a specific agreement hash. Sellers operating auto-accept MUST hold the auto-signing key in a system that produces live instance signatures on demand (HSM, TEE, hot wallet with rate-limiting).
**Substrate:** SR-2 only.

#### 8.4.2 negotiate-rfq

Bounded multi-turn offer-and-counter exchange in a private channel.

```
type NegotiateRfqInput = {

  jobId: string

  listingHash: string

  listingRef: { listingId: string; version: number }

  buyerBundle: IdentityBundle

  sellerBundle: IdentityBundle

  buyerVetRef: AttestationRef

  sellerVetRef: AttestationRef

  parameters: {

    maxTurns: number                   // hard cap; default 6; MUST be >= 2

    timeoutSec: number                 // per-turn timeout

    channelSubnet?: string             // SR-4 channel id; substrate-specific

    rfqInitiator?: "buyer" | "seller"  // who sends the first offer; default "buyer"

  }

  sessionContext: SessionContext

}

type NegotiateRfqOutput = PhaseHandlerResult & {

  contextDelta?: {   // present only on ok:true; a failed phase (reject / maxTurns / timeout) returns a bare PhaseHandlerResult

    "negotiate-rfq": {

      agreementHash: string

      agreementRef: AttestationRef

      turnCount: number

      channelTranscriptRef?: AttestationRef  // optional; member-only-decryptable

    }

  }

}
```

**Procedure.** The orchestrator (driving the buyer-side flow) MUST: (1) establish an SR-4 channel between buyerBundle.presentedBy and sellerBundle.presentedBy; (2) send an initial offer — buyer (or seller, per the negotiate-rfq `rfqInitiator` phase parameter; default `buyer`) sends a turn of type offer with proposed terms; (3) iterate — each side MAY respond with counter, accept, or reject; iteration continues until accept is received (proceed), reject is received (terminate; counterparty class), maxTurns is reached without accept (terminate; counterparty class), or timeoutSec elapses without a response (terminate; counterparty or substrate class); (4) construct the AgreementDocument with derivedFromPattern: "rfq" and the agreed terms, sign and send as a final message; (5) collect co-signatures from all parties; (6) anchor the agreement via SR-2; (7) optionally, if all parties consent, anchor the encrypted transcript via SR-2 with a channelTranscriptRef. Consent MUST be explicit; default is no transcript anchoring.
**Conformance.** (RFQ-1) maxTurns MUST be ≥ 2. (RFQ-2) Each turn MUST conform to the channel message envelope. (RFQ-3) Final terms MUST conform to the listing’s pricing band — counters proposing terms outside the band MUST be rejected client-side; signed agreements with out-of-band terms MUST be rejected by commit-agreement. (RFQ-4) Implementations MUST enforce the turn timeout; missed-timeout abandonment MUST be treated as channel failure. **Substrate:** SR-2 + SR-4.

#### 8.4.3 negotiate-sealed-envelope

Sealed-bid procurement: all bidders submit hash-committed bids before a deadline; bids are revealed after the deadline; winner is selected per the listing’s selection criterion.

```
type NegotiateSealedEnvelopeInput = {

  jobId: string

  listingHash: string

  listingRef: { listingId: string; version: number }

  buyerBundles: IdentityBundle[]       // all bidders' bundles

  sellerBundle: IdentityBundle         // listing publisher

  buyerVetRefs: AttestationRef[]

  sellerVetRef: AttestationRef

  parameters: {

    commitDeadline: number             // unix ms; MUST be > now

    revealWindow: number               // seconds after commitDeadline; MUST be >= 60

    selectionRule: "lowest-price" | "highest-price" | "first-acceptable" | "rule-ref:<contentHash>:<uri>"

    channelSubnet?: string

  }

  sessionContext: SessionContext

}

type NegotiateSealedEnvelopeOutput = PhaseHandlerResult & {

  contextDelta?: {   // present only on ok:true; a failed phase (no winning bid) returns a bare PhaseHandlerResult

    "negotiate-sealed-envelope": {

      agreementHash: string

      agreementRef: AttestationRef

      winningBidderClaim: ClaimReference

      revealedBidRefs: AttestationRef[]

      losingBidderClaims: ClaimReference[]

    }

  }

}
```

**Procedure.** The orchestrator MUST: (1) establish SR-4 channels between the seller and each bidder; (2) **bidder commit phase** (before commitDeadline) — each bidder constructs a bid and a fresh salt (per SE-7), computes bidHash = sha256("dacs-sealed-bid:v1:" || sha256(canonical_JCS(bid)) || salt) — the bid is hashed to a fixed 32-byte digest before concatenation so the bid/salt boundary is unambiguous, and the leading domain tag separates this commitment from any other sha256 usage — and sends a sealed-envelope-commit message {bidHash, bidderClaim, commitTimestamp} — `commitTimestamp` is informational only and MUST NOT be used for any deadline gate, ordering, or tie-break (the SR-2 anchor timestamp is authoritative per SE-2/SE-5); the commit message’s bidHash MUST also be anchored via SR-2; (3) at commitDeadline, no further commits are accepted; the orchestrator records the set of received commits; (4) **bidder reveal phase** (within revealWindow) — each bidder sends a sealed-envelope-reveal message {bid, salt} matching their prior bidHash; orchestrator verifies sha256("dacs-sealed-bid:v1:" || sha256(canonical_JCS(bid)) || salt) == bidHash; mismatches cause exclusion; **each bidder MUST anchor its own reveal record via SR-2 before revealWindow expiry** (the bidder, not the orchestrator — so a malicious orchestrator cannot suppress an honest in-window reveal by withholding its anchor), giving an objective anchor timestamp for SE-3 enforcement and on-chain proof of timely reveal; (5) **selection** — if the listing's auction PricingSpec declares `reservePrice`, the orchestrator MUST first exclude bids that fail the reserve (for `highest-price`: `amount < reservePrice`; for `lowest-price`: `amount > reservePrice`), and if no revealed bid satisfies the reserve the phase fails with no winning bid (bare PhaseHandlerResult); then the orchestrator applies the **phase-step `parameters.selectionRule`** — which is content-hash-bound into the listing pipeline per §6.3.4 and is the authoritative selection rule; the auction PricingSpec's own `selectionRule` MUST equal it (a listing whose two values disagree is non-conformant) — ties resolved by earliest SR-2 anchor timestamp of the bidder's commit (the same objective, substrate-determined timestamp SE-2 uses for the deadline gate — *not* the self-reported commitTimestamp field), and any remaining ties (commits anchored in the same block / with equal anchor timestamps) resolved by ascending lexicographic order of bidHash; (6) construct the AgreementDocument from the winning bid with derivedFromPattern: "sealed-envelope", then collect the seller's and the winning bidder's co-signatures — the §8.5.1 required signers (losing bidders are listed as bidder-non-winning parties and their signatures are not required); (7) anchor the agreement via SR-2 (each reveal record was already anchored by its own bidder in step 4).
**Sealed bid body schema**
The body of a sealed-envelope-reveal message (the revealed `bid`, and therefore the value committed to in step 2) MUST conform to:
```
type SealedBid = {

  price: PriceTerm                     // the bid amount and currency

  deliverable?: DeliverableRef         // what the bidder undertakes to deliver

  terms?: Record<string, unknown>      // additional pattern- or listing-specific terms

}
```
The `bid` over which `bidHash` is computed in step (2) is exactly this `SealedBid` object in its RFC 8785 JCS canonical form. All bids in a single session MUST be denominated in the listing-declared currency; a revealed bid whose `price.currency` does not match MUST be excluded from selection.

**Selection rules and the rule-ref binding requirement**
parameters.selectionRule is one of: "lowest-price"; "highest-price"; "first-acceptable" (per listing-defined acceptance criteria); "rule-ref:<contentHash>:<uri>". For "lowest-price" and "highest-price", the orchestrator MUST order revealed bids by `bid.price.amount` (compared as a decimal, full precision) ascending or descending respectively; this comparison is well-defined only because every candidate bid is in the listing-declared currency (bids whose `price.currency` does not match are already excluded above), so `amount` values are directly comparable and a cross-currency comparison can never occur. For "first-acceptable", the orchestrator MUST evaluate revealed bids in ascending order of the SR-2 anchor timestamp of each bidder's commit (the same objective clock as SE-2/SE-5, not the self-reported commitTimestamp field) against the listing-declared acceptance predicate and select the first that satisfies it. The acceptance predicate MUST be deterministic given the bid set and MUST be fixed before bids open — content-hash-bound into the listing (the same anti-swap discipline as rule-ref), so it cannot be changed after bids are seen; a non-deterministic or post-bid-mutable predicate MUST NOT be used. For rule-ref, the rule MUST be anchored as a Storage Program (or fetched from an HTTPS URI and content-hash-bound). The URI is purely informational; the <contentHash> in the selection rule string is the authoritative binding. Orchestrators MUST fetch the rule at <uri> (or the substrate anchor), compute sha256 of the canonical form, and verify it matches <contentHash>. Mismatch MUST exclude the rule and fail the selection step with errorClass: permanent. This prevents a seller from changing the selection algorithm after bids have been submitted by changing the content served at <uri>.
**Conformance.** (SE-1) commitDeadline MUST be at least 60 seconds in the future at session start. (SE-2) Every bidder commit MUST be anchored before commitDeadline; commits whose anchor timestamp is after commitDeadline MUST be excluded. (SE-3) Every revealed bid MUST be anchored via SR-2 before revealWindow expiry; reveals whose anchor timestamp is after revealWindow expiry MUST be excluded. This mirrors SE-2: the substrate anchor timestamp — not a channel message's self-reported sentAt or the orchestrator's wall clock — is the authoritative clock that decides whether a reveal occurred in-window. (SE-4) Bidders failing reveal MUST be excluded from selection and MAY be marked with a failure-to-reveal reputation event (DACS-5). (SE-5) The selection rule MUST be deterministic; ties MUST resolve consistently. The tie-break MUST use the objective SR-2 anchor timestamp of each bidder's commit (the same clock as SE-2), MUST NOT use the self-reported commitTimestamp field, and MUST resolve same-anchor-timestamp ties by ascending lexicographic order of bidHash. (SE-6) rule-ref selection rules MUST be content-hash-bound and the rule content MUST itself be deterministic given the bid set. (SE-7) **Bid-commitment salt.** The `salt` used in the bidHash commitment MUST be generated from a cryptographically-secure random source with at least 256 bits (32 bytes) of entropy, MUST NOT be reused across bids or sessions, and MUST be carried on the wire as a base64url string so the bytes hashed are unambiguous to both committer and verifier; the commitment input is the raw decoded salt bytes. This closes the pre-reveal brute-force leak created by anchoring bidHash publicly (§8.12) for low-entropy structured bids, and aligns the sealed-envelope salt with the HTLC-1 salt discipline. **Substrate:** SR-2 + SR-4.

#### 8.5.1 Canonical serialisation and signature

The agreement’s canonical form is the RFC 8785 JCS serialisation with the signatures field omitted. **Rule CD-1 (canonical decimal).** Because RFC 8785 JCS canonicalises JSON numbers but preserves string bytes verbatim, every `PriceTerm.amount` string MUST be in minimal-digit canonical decimal form: no leading zeros (except a single `0` before the decimal point), no trailing zeros after the decimal point, `.` as the only separator, no `+` sign, and no exponent. Producers MUST canonicalise `amount` per CD-1 before computing any agreement hash, `SettlementEvidence` hash, or other JCS hash; verifiers MUST canonicalise `amount` per CD-1 before the §8.5.2 price-band and price-equality comparisons. Two parties formatting the same economic value differently (e.g. `"1.50"` vs `"1.5"`) MUST therefore reproduce identical canonical bytes, hashes, and signatures. The agreement hash is sha256(canonical_form), hex-encoded. Each AgreementSignature.value is computed over the domain-separated payload per chapter 7§7.7:
signed_bytes := "dacs-agreement:v1:" || agreement_hash
Verifiers MUST recompute the canonical form, agreement hash, and domain-separated payload, and for each required party, resolve the primary claim’s key (per DACS-2 verification) and verify the signature. Required signers: negotiate-fixed-price — buyer + seller (seller signature may be an auto-accept instance signature per §8.4.1); negotiate-rfq — buyer + seller; negotiate-sealed-envelope — seller + winning bidder (non-winning bidders’ signatures are not required).

**`priceAnchor` canonical-form note.** When `terms.priceAnchor` is present, it is included in the JCS canonical form (the same as any other field in `terms`) and therefore covered by both parties’ signatures. `priceAnchor.price` MUST be in CD-1 canonical decimal form. Verifiers that do not understand `priceAnchor` MUST NOT reject the agreement on that basis — the field is optional and non-normative for agreement validity; it is informational. When a consumer *does* use `priceAnchor` for audit, it MUST resolve `priceAnchor.attestationRef` to a valid SR-3 attestation and confirm `attestationRef.contentHash` equals sha256 of the raw response body; but absence of `priceAnchor` MUST NOT cause rejection.

#### 8.5.2 Listing conformance validation

A verifier MUST validate the agreement against its referenced listing: terms.price.currency MUST equal the listing pricing currency (for negotiable pricing, bandCenter.currency; for fixed pricing, the listed price currency) — a band or equality comparison across differing currencies MUST be rejected before any amount comparison; terms.price MUST lie within the listing’s pricing band (if pricing is negotiable, within the band declared by the negotiable variant's `minPct` / `maxPct` fields around `bandCenter` — `minPct` and `maxPct` are non-negative percentages and the admissible band is the **inclusive** interval [`bandCenter.amount × (100 − minPct) / 100`, `bandCenter.amount × (100 + maxPct) / 100`]; both bounds MUST be canonicalised per CD-1 before comparison and `terms.price.amount`, compared as a full-precision decimal, MUST be ≥ the lower bound and ≤ the upper bound; if `derivedFromPattern == "fixed-price"` over negotiable pricing, `terms.price` MUST instead equal `bandCenter` exactly per CD-1, not merely lie within the band — see PS-3; if fixed pricing, equal to the listed price); terms.rail MUST appear in listing.acceptedRails; terms.deliverable MUST conform to the listing’s offering.deliverable — specifically: terms.deliverable.deliverableType MUST equal the listing offering.deliverable kind, terms.deliverable.hash MUST equal the canonical DeliverableRef.hash of the listing’s offering.deliverable (per §9.3), and terms.deliverable.schemaUrl MUST equal the listing offering.deliverable.schemaUrl (both absent, or both present and equal); terms.deadline MUST be ≤ committedAt + listing.terms.deadlineSecAfterCommit, where committedAt is the SR-2 anchor timestamp of the commitment record (§8.6) — the same objective, substrate-determined clock SE-2 uses — NOT the self-reported `generatedAt`, which a party could backdate to widen the settle window; the listing's `validity.notAfter` (if set) MUST be ≥ committedAt — the listing MUST NOT have expired between read and commit-agreement (the §6.3.4 step-3 read-time check governs discovery; this re-check governs commit, closing the read-to-commit interval); derivedFromPattern MUST match the listing’s pipeline-declared negotiation pattern. Agreements failing any check MUST be rejected by commit-agreement.

**Ordering of the `committedAt`-relative checks.** The deadline and `notAfter` checks above reference `committedAt` — the commitment record's SR-2 anchor timestamp (§8.6) — which only exists *after* the commitment is anchored (§8.6 step 5), later than the value checks at §8.6 step 3. So: the value-independent checks (currency, price-band, rail, deliverable, pattern) gate pre-anchor at step 3; the two `committedAt`-relative checks are authoritative against the anchored `committedAt` — the orchestrator performs a provisional check against the current clock before anchoring, then MUST re-evaluate them against the actual anchored `committedAt`, and any consumer/verifier reading the anchored commitment MUST likewise re-check them against `committedAt`. A commitment whose anchored `committedAt` violates either check is invalid. This keeps `committedAt` the objective anti-backdating clock (the §6.3.4 read-time check still governs discovery) without a circular dependency on an as-yet-unanchored value.

### 8.6 Commitment phase (commit-agreement)

The DACS-3 phase that anchors the agreement hash on the public chain.

```
type CommitAgreementInput = {

  jobId: string

  agreement: AgreementDocument

  listingRef: { listingId: string; version: number; contentHash: string }

  sessionContext: SessionContext

}

type CommitAgreementOutput = PhaseHandlerResult & {

  contextDelta: {

    "commit-agreement": {

      agreementHash: string

      anchorTxRef: TxRef

      committedAt: number

    }

  }

}
```

**Procedure.** The orchestrator MUST: (1) compute agreementHash = sha256(canonical_JCS(agreement)) with signatures omitted; (2) verify all required signatures are present and valid; (3) validate the agreement against the listing per §8.5.2 — the value checks (currency/band/rail/deliverable/pattern) gate here, while the two `committedAt`-relative checks (deadline, `notAfter`) are re-evaluated against the anchored `committedAt` after step 5 per the §8.5.2 ordering note; any validation failure MUST cause the phase to fail with class permanent; (4) construct the on-chain commitment record:

```
type CommitmentRecord = {

  dacsVersion: "1"

  jobId: string

  agreementHash: string

  listingRef: { listingId: string; version: number; contentHash: string }

  parties: ClaimReference[]          // primary claims of signing parties

  pattern: "fixed-price" | "rfq" | "sealed-envelope"

  committedAt: number

}
```

(5) anchor the commitment record via SR-2 at address dacs3:commit:{jobId} (or substrate-equivalent), with the orchestrator signature over the domain-separated payload "dacs-commitment:v1:" || sha256(canonical_JCS(commitmentRecord_without_signature)); (6) return agreementHash and anchorTxRef.
**Conformance.** (CA-1) The orchestrator MUST NOT advance to DACS-4 (Settle) until commit-agreement returns ok: true. (CA-2) Commitment records MUST be anchored on the public chain (not in a private channel). (CA-3) Once anchored, the commitment is immutable. Re-commitments for the same jobId MUST be rejected. (CA-4) The agreement document itself MAY be anchored separately (publicly or privately). For institutional flows, the agreement document is typically NOT anchored on the public chain — only its hash is. Parties retain the agreement document off-chain (or encrypted-anchored).

### 8.7 Channel transcript and disclosure

Negotiation channels produce a transcript: the ordered sequence of signed messages between participants. The transcript is private to channel members. When a transcript is anchored (see disclosure policies below), its signature is computed over the domain-separated payload "dacs-transcript:v1:" || sha256(canonical_JCS(transcript_without_signatures)) per chapter 7§7.7.

```
type ChannelTranscript = {

  transcriptVersion: "1"

  channelId: string

  members: ClaimReference[]

  messages: ChannelMessage[]

  generatedAt: number

  signatures: TranscriptSignature[]

}
```

**Default disclosure: none.** By default, the transcript is not anchored on the public chain. Only the agreement hash (via commit-agreement) is public. The DACS-1 listing’s terms.transcriptDisclosurePolicy controls this per-listing:

- "none" (default) — transcripts stay in the channel; no anchoring required.
- "encrypted-anchored-recommended" — orchestrators SHOULD anchor transcripts encrypted to channel members; not required.
- "encrypted-anchored-required" — orchestrators MUST anchor encrypted transcripts; absence of transcript anchor MUST fail the phase. Recommended for sessions whose counterparty is a regulated entity that may be subject to subpoena.

If all channel members consent, the transcript MAY be encrypted to the member set and anchored via SR-2. The AgreementDocument.derivedFromChannel.lastMessageHash provides a verifiable hook from the public agreement to the (private) transcript. A future DACS standard (proposed DACS-X dispute) MAY require selective transcript disclosure under signed party agreement or arbitrator order. v0.1 does not specify dispute resolution; parties intending to support dispute SHOULD anchor encrypted transcripts at agreement time so disclosure is technically possible later.

### 8.8 Pattern selection by listing

A DACS-1 listing’s pipeline declares which negotiation pattern is used. Each PhaseStep of kind negotiate-* specifies the pattern and its parameters.
**Validation.** (PS-1) A pipeline MUST contain exactly one negotiate-*phase. (PS-2) A pipeline MUST contain exactly one commit-agreement phase, immediately following the negotiate-* phase. (PS-3) The listing’s pricing model MUST be compatible with the chosen pattern: negotiate-fixed-price MUST be fixed or negotiable (in which case fixed-price uses the band’s centre); negotiate-rfq MUST be negotiable; negotiate-sealed-envelope MUST be auction.
**Fallback to fixed-price.** A listing offering negotiate-rfq MAY declare fixedPriceFallback: true in the pipeline step. When true, a buyer that does not wish to negotiate MAY signal acceptance of the listed centre-price via negotiate-fixed-price. The orchestrator selects which pattern runs based on buyer signal. The fallback path produces a normal AgreementDocument with derivedFromPattern: "fixed-price".
**Multi-quote RFQ (deferred to v0.2).** The v0.1 negotiate-rfq phase is bilateral (one buyer, one seller). Real institutional RFQ is often one-to-many — a buyer queries N liquidity providers, collects quotes, picks one. v0.1 does not support multi-quote RFQ directly; the closest pattern is negotiate-sealed-envelope with selectionRule: first-acceptable or lowest-price. A first-class negotiate-multi-quote phase is anticipated for v0.2.

### 8.9 Conformance summary

| Role | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Channel implementation | CH-1 through CH-6; message envelope; failure detection |
| negotiate-fixed-price | §8.4.1 procedure; signature collection; SR-2 anchoring |
| negotiate-rfq | §8.4.2 procedure; RFQ-1 through RFQ-4; channel turn timeouts |
| negotiate-sealed-envelope | §8.4.3 procedure; SE-1 through SE-7; deterministic selection; rule-ref content-hash binding |
| commit-agreement | CA-1 through CA-4; signature and conformance validation |
| Listing publisher | PS-1 through PS-3 |
| Substrate without SR-4 | MUST support negotiate-fixed-price; MUST refuse negotiate-rfq and negotiate-sealed-envelope with a clear substrate-capability-missing error |

### 8.10 Rationale

**Three patterns vs more, fewer, or open registry.** Three is the smallest set that covers the demonstrated commerce surface: micropayments and SaaS use fixed-price; institutional bilateral negotiation uses RFQ; sealed-bid procurement uses sealed-envelope. Open registries lose conformance testability. More patterns (auction-english, auction-dutch, multi-round-RFQ-with-deltas) are deferred to v2 once v0.1’s set ships with real users.
**Closed pattern set in v0.1 vs open from day one.** The pattern set determines what a generic orchestrator must implement. A closed set lets every conforming orchestrator handle every conforming listing. An open set means listings can declare patterns no orchestrator supports — fragmentation by design.
**Single AgreementDocument shape across patterns vs pattern-specific shapes.** The same downstream stages (Settle, Verify) consume agreements regardless of how they were negotiated. A uniform shape lets DACS-4 and DACS-5 stay pattern-agnostic. Pattern-specific data lives in additionalTerms and in optional fields (e.g., derivedFromChannel).
**Channel transcript private by default vs anchored-with-encryption.** Anchoring transcripts by default would be expensive (transcripts can be large) and politically fraught (operators would not adopt a standard that anchors their negotiation history, even encrypted). Default-private with opt-in anchoring matches institutional practice: keep the negotiation private, anchor the binding outcome. Parties who need transcript audit (regulated flows) opt in.
**commit-agreement as a separate phase vs implicit in the negotiation phase output.** A separate phase makes the public-chain commitment visible in the pipeline, lets the orchestrator validate signature and conformance before the agreement becomes binding, and provides a clear hook for downstream Settle/Verify. Implicit commitment hides the binding moment and complicates failure recovery.
**SR-4 as required for private vs alternative substrate primitives.** SR-4 is an abstract capability; substrates can realise it via private subnets (Demos), TEEs (with documented trust trade-offs), permissioned channels (where appropriate), or zk-based confidential channels. DACS-3 does not pick a winner among realisations; it specifies the abstract capability and the per-pattern requirements.
**Sealed-envelope: commit anchored, reveal in channel.** The commit hash on the public chain prevents back-dating and repudiation; the reveal stays in the channel to avoid leaking losing bids publicly. This matches government sealed-bid practice: bids are sealed in advance, revealed only to the procurement officer at opening time, and losing bid amounts are typically not disclosed.

### 8.11 Backwards compatibility

**Institutional RFQ workflows.** A Demos-hosted RFQ run via negotiate-rfq maps to existing institutional bilateral RFQ in the same way a Bloomberg chat RFQ maps to a Symphony RFQ: same semantic shape, different transport. The transport is the SR-4 channel; the semantic shape is the DACS-3 phase. Existing RFQ desks can adopt DACS-3 RFQ without changing their negotiation logic — they wrap their existing logic as a DACS-3 phase implementation.
**Sealed-bid government procurement.** FAR Part 14 (sealed bidding) and FAR Part 15 (contracting by negotiation) describe the US federal patterns. DACS-3’s negotiate-sealed-envelope covers FAR Part 14’s commit-then-reveal pattern with the addition of cryptographic commitment (the FAR pattern uses physical sealed envelopes). The selection-rule abstraction (lowest-price, first-acceptable, rule-ref) covers FAR’s "lowest responsive responsible bidder" and "best value" criteria. International equivalents (EU procurement directives, UK Crown Commercial Service) map similarly.
**Off-chain negotiation systems (existing).** A negotiation system that already exists (an institutional desk’s RFQ system, a procurement portal, a B2B contract negotiation tool) MAY function as the SR-4 channel for DACS-3 purposes provided it satisfies CH-1 through CH-6. The public-chain binding (commit-agreement) and the agreement document shape are the DACS-3 additions; the negotiation transport can be existing infrastructure.
**ERC-8183 escrow.** ERC-8183 introduces an EVM-native escrow primitive for job-style transactions. A DACS-3 agreement whose terms.rail is an EVM rail MAY reference an ERC-8183 escrow as the settlement vehicle; the rail definition (DACS-4) carries the ERC-8183 contract address.
**Future negotiation patterns.** New patterns (auctions, multi-round delta-RFQ) are added via the DACS-3 version process. Adding a pattern requires registering its phase-handler contract, parameters, and substrate requirements.

### 8.12 Security considerations

**Channel-operator censorship.** *Threat:* the SR-4 channel operator drops messages, preventing a party from responding within the timeout. *Mitigation:* CH-4 mandates liveness detection. Members observing missed deliveries (no acknowledgement from a quorum) MUST treat the channel as failed. On Demos, Private Negotiation provides per-message acknowledgements; equivalent SR-4 implementations on other substrates SHOULD do the same.
**Channel-operator forking.** *Threat:* the channel operator shows different views to different members, creating mutual misunderstanding. *Mitigation:* channel message envelopes carry monotonic sequence numbers and signatures; members SHOULD periodically exchange "current state" attestations and detect forks. SR-4 implementations are expected to provide a tamper-evident message log.
**Replay of offers across sessions.** *Threat:* an attacker captures a signed offer from session A and replays it in session B. *Mitigation:* the channel message envelope includes channelId and sequence (per-channel monotonic). This defence holds only if channelId is unique per session: **(CH-6) channelId MUST be unique per session** — the substrate MUST derive a per-session-unique channelId, and an orchestrator MUST reject a session that reuses a channelId from a prior session. (Without CH-6 the replay defence is vacuous: a reused channelId would let a session-A offer verify in session B.) Given CH-6, an offer replayed into a different channel fails signature verification because the channelId differs; replayed in the same channel it duplicates a sequence number and is rejected.
**Signature stripping or rebinding between channel and agreement.** *Threat:* an attacker takes a signature produced inside the channel and reuses it on a different agreement document. *Mitigation:* channel-message signatures are over the message envelope (including channelId); agreement-document signatures are over the agreement hash (which includes jobId, listingRef, and all terms). The two scopes are non-overlapping; a channel signature does not validate as an agreement signature.
**Sealed-envelope front-running.** *Threat:* a bidder learns competitors’ bids before reveal. *Mitigation:* bids stay encrypted in the channel until reveal; only the bid hash is public. The channel’s confidentiality ensures non-members cannot read pre-reveal bids; the cryptographic commitment ensures the bidder cannot change their bid after observing competitors at reveal time. Operators SHOULD use SR-4 implementations with member-exclusive encryption.
**Sealed-envelope post-deadline submission.** *Threat:* a bidder submits a commit after commitDeadline, claiming clock skew. *Mitigation:* SE-2 mandates the commit’s public-chain anchor timestamp (objective, substrate-determined) be ≤ commitDeadline. Clock skew at the bidder is irrelevant; the chain decides the timestamp.
**Agreement-listing mismatch.** *Threat:* a signed agreement contains terms outside the listing’s pricing band or with an unaccepted rail. *Mitigation:* validation rules; commit-agreement must reject. Both sides also SHOULD validate before signing.
**Multi-party signing race.** *Threat:* one party signs an agreement; before the other co-signs, the first party publicly commits and locks the other in. *Mitigation:* commit-agreement requires all required signatures present. A unilaterally-signed agreement fails CA. A future minor version MAY add pending-co-signature semantics for asynchronous flows; v0.1 requires synchronous signature collection.
**Public-chain timing analysis.** *Threat:* the pattern of commitment timestamps on the public chain reveals negotiation patterns. *Mitigation:* this is a fundamental property of any commit-on-chain protocol. Parties concerned with timing leak SHOULD use SR-4 channels with timing-padded delivery, anchor commitments at random intervals within a window, or settle through privacy-preserving rails. DACS-3 does not standardise timing obfuscation.
**Identity substitution between Vet and agreement signature.** *Threat:* a party’s bundle is verified in DACS-2 but they sign the agreement with a different key. *Mitigation:* AgreementSignature.party references the primary claim from the bundle. The signature key MUST be the one bound to that claim. Mismatches cause commit-agreement to fail.
**Channel-membership exfiltration.** *Threat:* the channel operator (or a compromised member) leaks the negotiation transcript publicly. *Mitigation:* DACS-3 cannot prevent this technically — once a member sees the transcript, they can leak it. Listings handling sensitive flows SHOULD restrict membership to known counterparties; the leak risk reduces to counterparty-trust risk, which DACS-2 verification helps quantify.
**Late-revealing bidder denial-of-service.** *Threat:* in sealed-envelope, a bidder commits and then deliberately fails to reveal, hoping to disrupt the auction. *Mitigation:* SE-4 excludes non-revealing bidders from selection and marks them with a reputation event. Repeated failures damage their DACS-5 reputation. Listings MAY require a stake from bidders (escrowed at commit, returned on reveal) to make denial-of-service costly; v0.1 does not standardise stake.

**Orchestrator / seller reveal manipulation.** *Threat:* the sealed-envelope channels are seller↔bidder and the orchestrator drives them, so the orchestrator (and, when the seller acts as orchestrator, the seller) is a member of every bidder's channel and could (a) learn each revealed bid as it arrives during the revealWindow and steer a favoured bidder, or (b) suppress an honest low bid by withholding its reveal anchor so SE-3 excludes it. The bidHash commitment prevents *changing* a bid but not these manipulations. *Mitigation (v0.1):* reveal records are anchored by the **bidder**, not the orchestrator (procedure step 4), so an excluded bidder holds on-chain proof of a timely in-window reveal and the orchestrator cannot silently drop it; SE-5 makes selection deterministic and rule-ref-bound (SE-6) so a favoured-bidder steer is detectable against the anchored bid set. *Residual:* v0.1's single-orchestrator model still trusts the orchestrator not to leak interim reveals to the seller before revealWindow close; listings sensitive to this SHOULD use a neutral (non-seller) orchestrator or a commit-to-all-then-reveal-to-all discipline. A simultaneous-reveal cryptographic scheme is a roadmap candidate.
**RFQ session-initiation flooding.** *Threat:* a malicious counterparty repeatedly opens RFQ sessions and sends valueless `counter` turns up to `maxTurns`, forcing the victim's orchestrator to establish an SR-4 channel and process and sign turns at near-zero cost to the attacker. *Mitigation:* RFQ-1..RFQ-4 and `timeoutSec` bound a single session's turn count and per-turn wait, but v0.1 does not standardise a cap on the rate of session initiations per counterparty. Orchestrators SHOULD enforce a per-counterparty session-initiation rate limit (analogous to the per-session ERC-8004 write rate limit of §10.11) and MAY require a DACS-2 verification floor before admitting an RFQ initiator. This is a partial defence: the asymmetry between the attacker's initiation cost and the victim's per-session processing cost is not removed by v0.1.
**Sealed-envelope commit-spam.** *Threat:* SE-2 requires every bidder commit to be anchored via SR-2, and SE-1/SE-2 impose no stake and no bidder-eligibility check; an attacker floods an open auction with junk commits, each forcing an SR-2 anchor, inflating the seller's anchoring cost and the §10.4.2 extended-pointer bundle size. *Mitigation:* the optional bidder-stake mechanism noted above (escrowed at commit) makes commit-spam costly, and listings MAY restrict the bidder set or require a DACS-2 verification floor at commit; sellers SHOULD rate-limit commit anchoring per counterparty. This is a partial defence because v0.1 does not standardise stake or a bidder-eligibility check; an open, stakeless auction remains exposed to anchoring-cost amplification.

## Chapter 9 — DACS-4: Settle

**Stage:** Settle (4th of 5). **Status:** Draft (part of DACS v0.1). **Depends on:** SR-2 (required), SR-5 (required for cross-chain rails only); composes with AP2, x402, ERC-20, SPL, HTLC contracts, and substrate-native bridges (Liquidity Tanks on Demos). **Used by:** DACS-5 (settlement evidence in session bundle).

### 9.1 Abstract

DACS-4 specifies how value is exchanged and the deliverable provided once a DACS-3 agreement is committed. It defines:

- A **payment rail registry** — a versioned, anchored set of payment rails. Each rail is a typed envelope identifying the chain or network, the asset, the settlement contract or protocol, and any rail-specific parameters.
- A **closed set of payment phases** (DACS-4 phase types) — pay-evm-erc20, pay-solana-spl, pay-cross-chain-htlc, pay-cross-chain-liquidity-tank, pay-ap2, pay-x402. Each is a phase with a uniform PhaseHandlerResult shape.
- A **closed set of delivery phases** — deliver-storage-program, deliver-entitlement, deliver-attested-payload. Each produces SettlementEvidence the rest of the stack consumes.
- A **uniform SettlementEvidence shape** — the record produced by every payment and delivery phase; the substrate-anchored audit unit referenced by DACS-5.
- A **cross-chain coordination layer** — atomic settlement primitives (HTLC, Liquidity Tank) so a payment on chain A and a delivery on chain B succeed together or not at all.

Payment and delivery are decoupled: a listing’s pipeline composes one or more payment phases with one or more delivery phases, in any order the seller deems safe. The DACS-3 agreement document carries the chosen rail and deliverable references; DACS-4 phases consume them and produce evidence DACS-5 anchors.

### 9.2 Motivation

Settlement is the stage where the most working open standards exist. Stablecoin transfers, ERC-20 / SPL token movements, HTLC swaps, AP2 payment mandates, and x402-style HTTP micropayments all ship in production today. None of them, individually, is sufficient for the agent commerce lifecycle, because each addresses a single slice:

- **AP2** (FIDO Alliance custodian since April 2026) specifies how payment authorisation is mandated by a user to an agent. AP2 says *who is authorised to pay how much for what*. It does not say *how the payment is routed*, *how delivery is bound to payment*, or *what audit record results*.
- **x402** (Coinbase / Cloudflare / Anthropic) specifies HTTP 402 micropayments. x402 says *how an HTTP server requests payment and how a client supplies it*. It does not cover agent-to-agent settlement that is not over HTTP.
- **ERC-20 / SPL** specify token transfer. They say *how value moves on chain X*. They do not cover cross-chain coordination, delivery binding, or evidence production.
- **HTLC contracts** specify atomic cross-chain swaps. They cover coordination but not the rest of the lifecycle.

DACS-4 composes these standards into a uniform settlement layer. The payment rail registry routes each rail to its appropriate phase handler; the SettlementEvidence shape lets DACS-5 anchor the result regardless of which rail was used; the cross-chain coordination layer extends to settlements that span chains.
A second motivation is **scope discipline**: DACS-4 does not specify new payment cryptography. It composes existing protocols, adds the registry and evidence schema, and provides cross-chain coordination via substrate primitives (SR-5). The new bytes-on-the-wire are limited to the rail registry, the SettlementEvidence shape, and the phase-handler contracts.

### 9.3 Shared types

These types are referenced by DACS-1 (listings), DACS-3 (agreements), DACS-4 (this chapter), and DACS-5 (session record).

```

**DeliverableRef canonical hash.** `DeliverableRef.hash` is `sha256(canonical_form)`, hex-encoded, where `canonical_form` is the RFC 8785 JCS serialisation of the `DeliverableSpec` — the same canonicalisation rule used for every other hashed artifact in DACS (listing §6.3.4, agreement §8.5.1). Because `DeliverableSpec` is a discriminated union with optional fields, the JCS rule (lexicographic key ordering, omitted-vs-present fields canonicalised consistently) is what makes the hash reproducible across implementations. To keep the §8.5.2 conformance check byte-for-byte deterministic, both parties MUST compute this hash over the listing's `offering.deliverable` value as anchored, not over a separately re-derived copy.

**PriceTerm.amount positivity (normative).** `PriceTerm.amount` MUST be a positive decimal: it MUST parse to a finite value strictly greater than zero, and MUST NOT be NaN, infinite, or negative. Because `PriceTerm` is the canonical economic primitive consumed by automated winner-selection over adversarial bids (§8.4.3), band validation (§8.5.2), and on-chain amount construction (§9.5.2), conformant implementations MUST reject any bid, listing price, or agreed price whose `amount` is non-positive — before applying `selectionRule` and before commit-agreement. A revealed bid that violates this constraint MUST be excluded from the candidate set rather than selected as a `lowest-price` winner.

### 9.4 Payment rail registry

A versioned, anchored set of payment rails. Each rail entry describes one settlement path.

#### 9.4.1 Rail schema

  network: NetworkSpec                 // where it lives

  phaseHandler: PhaseType              // which pay-* phase handles it

#### 9.4.2 v0.1 registry contents

The v0.1 registry contains rail entries for the most-used settlement paths in production. Implementations MUST resolve rails from the canonical addresses listed in the rail-registry index document (dacs4:registry:v0.1).

| Rail ID | Phase handler | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| evm-erc20:1:USDC | pay-evm-erc20 | Ethereum mainnet USDC |
| evm-erc20:8453:USDC | pay-evm-erc20 | Base mainnet USDC |
| evm-erc20:42161:USDC | pay-evm-erc20 | Arbitrum One USDC |
| evm-erc20:137:USDC | pay-evm-erc20 | Polygon mainnet USDC |
| solana-spl:mainnet:USDC | pay-solana-spl | Solana mainnet USDC |
| solana-spl:mainnet:USDT | pay-solana-spl | Solana mainnet USDT |
| cross-chain-htlc:USDC | pay-cross-chain-htlc | Atomic swap across EVM ↔ Solana for USDC |
| cross-chain-liquidity-tank:USDC | pay-cross-chain-liquidity-tank | Substrate-coordinated atomic settlement; on Demos: Liquidity Tanks. v0.1 supported routes: ETH Sepolia → Polygon Amoy unidirectional only |
| ap2:visa-direct | pay-ap2 | AP2 mandate to Visa Direct |
| ap2:mastercard-send | pay-ap2 | AP2 mandate to Mastercard Send |
| ap2:stripe-paymentintents | pay-ap2 | AP2 mandate to Stripe PaymentIntents |
| x402:default | pay-x402 | Generic x402 HTTP 402 micropayment |

**v0.1 cross-chain settlement scope.** pay-cross-chain-liquidity-tank is supported **only** for the live tank routes (ETH Sepolia ↔ Polygon Amoy testnet; USDC; EVM-source unidirectional). All other tank rails are 🟡 to-add and will unlock as Native Bridges Phase 2–4 ship (Solana tanks, bidirectional, additional EVM rails, mainnet deployments, non-USDC stablecoins). pay-cross-chain-htlc is the path the reference implementation runs today (929 LOC reference implementation: Solana Anchor program + Base Sepolia EVM HTLC contract, lock/reveal/refund implemented end-to-end). v0.1 keeps both first-class.

#### 9.4.3 Rail authoring and resolution

A conforming rail author MUST: (RD-1) sign the rail with the registry steward’s signing key over the domain-separated payload "dacs-rail:v1:" || rail_hash per chapter 7§7.7; (RD-2) anchor the rail via SR-2 at the canonical address; (RD-3) specify railVersion as monotonically increasing per railId; (RD-4) specify supersedes when replacing a prior rail with the same railId; (RD-5) ensure the railType matches the asset and network kinds (an evm-erc20 rail with a Solana asset MUST be rejected).
A consumer MUST resolve a rail by: reading the rail-registry index from dacs4:registry:v0.1; looking up the entry for the agreement’s terms.rail.railId; fetching the rail at the indicated anchor and verifying its content hash and signature; if the agreement pins a specific railVersion, MUST use that version; otherwise MUST use the latest at session start, pinned into the session.
**Progressive anchoring for early deployments.** The rail registry follows the same progressive anchoring pattern as the DACS-2 recipe registry (§7.4.4). Phase PA-1 (bootstrap): rails shipped as in-code constants. Phase PA-2 (current): rails anchored by the steward (currently KyneSys Labs) under a single signature. Phase PA-3 (future): rails anchored under multi-signature governance if and when a constituted body is established. Implementations MUST disclose which phase they operate in; consumers MUST verify the rail’s anchoring phase against their own trust requirements.

#### 9.4.4 Rail availability (normative)

Every RailDefinition MUST declare an availability value, with the same value set and semantics as recipe availability (§7.4.5). The value names the rail’s current operational status — what an orchestrator should actually expect when it tries to settle through this rail. Mapping is direct:

- **live** — settlement path runs end-to-end on the named network today. Typical for the major stablecoin-on-major-chain rails.
- **operator_gated** — rail technically functions but requires per-operator setup: pre-funded liquidity, licensed-agent registration (regulated fiat rails), API credentials with the payment processor, IP allow-listing.
- **closed_data** — rail targets a permissioned or non-public network. Rail shape is defined for forward compatibility but the path cannot run from an open operator.
- **bilateral** — rail runs only between counterparties with a pre-existing bilateral agreement (custom settlement contract, dedicated escrow agent, contracted clearing service).
- **mocked** — settlement path is stubbed for development or testing. MUST NOT be presented as a production rail.
- **disabled** — rail exists in the registry but the steward has marked it not-for-use. Orchestrators MUST NOT initiate new sessions selecting disabled rails; in-flight sessions continue.
- **failed** — rail’s underlying network or asset path is currently broken (chain congestion preventing settlement, asset contract paused, bridge offline).

**Orchestrator obligations.** (RAV-R1) An orchestrator MUST inspect rail availability before selecting a rail for a session. (RAV-R2) An orchestrator MUST NOT select rails with availability values disabled or failed. (RAV-R3) An orchestrator MAY select rails with availability values operator_gated, closed_data, or bilateral only if the relevant operator-side configuration is in place; this is a runtime preflight check, not a static property of the rail. (RAV-R4) A rail's `availability` is pinned at session start (§9.13), so a mid-session availability *flip* is not observable from the pinned definition. RAV-R4 therefore binds at the point of use: if a settlement attempt on the pinned rail fails because the rail is non-operational — a rail-down / substrate failure, distinct from a transient RPC hiccup or a counterparty error — the orchestrator MUST classify the failure errorClass = substrate (rail is non-operational), not counterparty. A proactive out-of-band rail-liveness probe that lets an orchestrator detect failure *before* attempting settlement (mirroring the §8.12 CH-4 channel-liveness probe) is a roadmap item; v0.1 detects rail failure at the settlement attempt. (RAV-R5) **Authoritative availability read.** An orchestrator MUST read `availability` from the authoritative rail definition — the signed/anchored `dacs-rail:v1:` record pinned at session start — NOT from an unauthenticated cache, discovery mirror, or counterparty-supplied copy. This closes availability-field poisoning, where a tampered pre-pin read would steer an orchestrator onto a disabled/failed rail (or away from a live one); the pinned, signed definition is the only trusted source.
**Steward obligations.** Same as recipe availability (RAV-5, RAV-6, RAV-7 in §7.4.5) applied to rails. The steward maintains availability values current; transitions are signed and anchored revisions; availability is per-rail-version.

### 9.5 Payment phases

The v0.1 closed set. Each is a PhaseType from chapter 6’s closed enumeration, with a phase-handler contract conforming to chapter 5’s SessionContext / PhaseHandlerResult.

#### 9.5.1 Common contract

Every pay-* phase handler MUST: (PC-1) accept a PaymentPhaseInput conforming to the shape below; (PC-2) produce SettlementEvidence anchored via SR-2 at dacs4:payment:{jobId}:{railId} (or substrate equivalent); (PC-3) return a PhaseHandlerResult with attestationRef pointing to the evidence; (PC-4) classify outcomes as exactly one of ok: true (payment confirmed at the chain’s finality semantics), ok: false with errorClass: "permanent" (refused by chain, insufficient balance, invalid signature), errorClass: "transient" (RPC failure, mempool congestion), errorClass: "counterparty" (AP2 mandate revoked, x402 server refused), errorClass: "substrate" (SR-2 unavailable), or errorClass: "settlement-atomicity" (cross-chain only; one leg of a cross-chain settlement reached a terminal or asymmetric state the other leg did not match — either a timeout, or the HTLC-9 preimage-revealed-but-counterpart-unclaimed state). For the HTLC-9 asymmetric-open sub-case the handler signals the open state and the orchestrator routes the session to the non-terminal `settle-asymmetric` state (§10.3.1, ST-8); a `settlement-atomicity` *terminal* (`settle-failed`) is reached only after the ST-8 recovery window expires unresolved; (PC-5) before settling, verify that `amount.currency` resolves to `rail.asset` and reject a mismatch as `ok: false` with `errorClass: "permanent"`; (PC-6) when outcome is `success`, populate `settlementFinality` in the produced SettlementEvidence with the finality model and parameters actually applied — the field MUST be present on any `success`-outcome payment evidence record and MUST be absent on delivery evidence records. "Resolves" is defined per AssetSpec kind: for `erc20` and `spl`, `amount.currency` MUST equal `rail.asset.symbol`; for `native-evm` and `native-solana`, `amount.currency` MUST equal `rail.asset.symbol`; for `fiat-via-ap2`, `amount.currency` MUST equal `rail.asset.isoCurrency`; for `stablecoin-cross-chain`, `amount.currency` MUST equal `rail.asset.canonicalSymbol`. Handlers MUST NOT settle a payment whose `amount.currency` does not resolve under this mapping.

#### 9.5.2 pay-evm-erc20

Single-chain ERC-20 token transfer.
**Procedure.** Resolves rail and verifies asset.kind == "erc20" and network.kind == "evm"; verifies amount.currency matches rail.asset.symbol; computes on-chain amount = amount.amount * 10^rail.asset.decimals (string-decimal multiplication, no float); constructs an ERC-20 transfer transaction: contract.transfer(payee.payeeAddress, amount); submits via the payer’s wallet (or via SR-3 proxy attestation when the payer’s wallet runs server-side); waits for chain finality per rail.parameters.finalityBlocks (default 1 for L2s, 12 for Ethereum mainnet); constructs SettlementEvidence with txRef of kind evm; anchors via SR-2; returns success.
**Failure modes.** payer balance insufficient → permanent; transfer reverts (contract restrictions, paused token) → permanent; chain unavailable → transient; payer-side wallet rejects → counterparty.

#### 9.5.3 pay-solana-spl

SPL token transfer on Solana.
**Procedure.** Resolves rail and verifies asset.kind == "spl"; constructs an SPL Transfer instruction (or TransferChecked for decimal safety); the payee’s token account is the destination (must exist or be created); submits via the payer’s wallet; waits for confirmation per rail.parameters.commitmentLevel (default "confirmed"); constructs SettlementEvidence with txRef of kind solana; anchors via SR-2; returns success.
**Failure modes.** Insufficient balance → permanent; token account does not exist and create-if-missing not allowed → counterparty (payee setup issue); cluster congestion / timeout → transient.

#### 9.5.4 pay-cross-chain-htlc

Atomic cross-chain settlement using HTLC contracts on source and destination chains.
**Procedure.** Resolves rail and verifies asset.kind == "stablecoin-cross-chain" and network.kind == "cross-chain" with mechanism: "htlc"; selects route from asset.routes matching (sourceChainId, destChainId); derives the preimage per rule HTLC-5 below: preimage = HKDF(IKM = buyerSalt, salt = jobId, info = agreementHash) using RFC 5869 with sha256; computes per-chain hashlocks hashlock_source = H_source(preimage), hashlock_dest = H_dest(preimage) where H_source and H_dest are the native hash functions of the source and destination chains respectively (keccak256 on EVM chains, sha256 on Solana and Bitcoin family chains, blake2b on Cosmos family chains); the **payer** (the preimage holder) locks on the source chain by calling htlcContracts.source.lock(payeeAddr, amount, hashlock_source, timelock_source) — beneficiary = payee, refund → payer; after source-lock finality (HTLC-8) the **payee** locks on the destination chain by calling htlcContracts.dest.lock(payerAddr, amount, hashlock_dest, timelock_dest) — beneficiary = payer, refund → payee — with timelock_source > timelock_dest per rule HTLC-7 below; the **payer then claims the destination** by calling htlcContracts.dest.claim(preimage), which pays the payer and reveals the preimage on-chain; the preimage now being public, the **payee claims the source** against hashlock_source; the collected txRefs are htlc-lock (source), htlc-reveal (the payer's destination claim), and htlc-claim (the payee's source-claim tx — the decisive success transaction). `outcome: "success"` is set **only once the payee's source claim has landed** — until then the state is the HTLC-9 asymmetric `dest-revealed-source-unclaimed` failure (the payer has been paid on the destination but the payee has not yet claimed the source), not a success. Constructs SettlementEvidence with the txRefs; anchors via SR-2; returns success. (This is the canonical atomic-swap order — the secret-holding payer claims the shorter-timelock destination first so the payee retains a guaranteed window on the longer-timelock source; see HTLC-7. The payer never *claims* the source; the source is the payee's to claim, and the payer's source position is recovered only via refund if the swap does not complete.)
**buyerSalt entropy and lifecycle (normative).** (HTLC-1) buyerSalt MUST be generated from a cryptographically-secure random source with at least 128 bits of entropy. (HTLC-2) buyerSalt MUST NOT be disclosed to any party other than the payer at any point during an active swap — i.e. not until both legs have either been claimed or refunded. buyerSalt is the long-lived IKM from which the preimage is derived (HTLC-5); it is *never* revealed on-chain (the destination claim reveals the **preimage**, not the salt). Disclosing the salt while either leg is still live lets an adversary recompute the preimage and claim whichever leg pays the preimage-submitter — the same race HTLC-7 guards. (There is no point during a live swap at which revealing the salt is safe; gating disclosure on source-lock finality alone would be incorrect.) (HTLC-3) buyerSalt MUST NOT be reused across sessions; each jobId uses a freshly-generated salt. (HTLC-4) buyerSalt MUST be retained by the payer until the destination-side claim transaction has reached finality (otherwise refund via timelock is still safe, but in-flight tracking and dispute become harder). (HTLC-5) **Preimage derivation** MUST use HKDF per RFC 5869 with sha256 as the KDF hash function; the IKM is buyerSalt, the salt is jobId, the info is agreementHash. Implementations MUST NOT use weaker preimage derivations. Because this derivation is deterministic, the preimage is unique only if its inputs are: jobId MUST be globally unique per swap and agreementHash MUST be collision-resistant (both hold in DACS — jobId is per-session and agreementHash is the sha256 of the canonical agreement) — a repeated (buyerSalt, jobId, agreementHash) tuple would reproduce a preimage and let an observer of the first reveal claim the second swap. Loss of buyerSalt makes the preimage unrecoverable, so the HTLC-4 retention requirement is a fund-safety requirement, not merely operational. (The deterministic derivation is retained over a plain random preimage because it lets a disputing party re-derive and prove the preimage from buyerSalt — directly serving the DACS-X dispute/correction path.) (HTLC-6) **Hashlock computation** is the chain-native hash function applied to the preimage. The source and destination chains MAY use different hash functions (e.g., keccak256 on EVM, sha256 on Solana). Implementations MUST NOT require both chains to share a hash function. The preimage is the only cross-chain-shared value; each side’s hashlock binds against its own native hash of that preimage. The preimage revealed on the destination chain is bit-identical to the preimage that produces hashlock_source under the source chain’s hash function. (HTLC-7) **Timelock asymmetry.** The source-chain timelock MUST be strictly greater than the destination-chain timelock, by a margin of at least the destination chain’s finality bound plus a safety window (RECOMMENDED: the larger of the two chains’ finality bounds). This prevents the timing race in which the preimage-holding payer reveals (claims the destination) just before the destination timelock expires while the payee can no longer claim the source: with timelock_source > timelock_dest + finality, once the payer’s destination claim reveals the preimage the payee retains a guaranteed window to claim the source. The finality margin MUST be sized conservatively — RECOMMENDED at least twice the destination chain’s worst-case (P99) confirmation latency, not its average — so that a destination claim observed-but-not-yet-final cannot strand the payee. The asymmetry that HTLC-7 guarantees is a property of the two locks’ **absolute expiry instants**, not of their configured durations alone: the safety property the implementation MUST verify is `expiry_source > expiry_dest + finality`, where each expiry is the wall-clock (or block-height) instant at which that chain’s timelock elapses. Implementations MUST reject a route whose configured timelocks cannot satisfy this inequality on absolute expiry instants under HTLC-8. (HTLC-8) **Timelock epoch (reference clock).** `timelockSourceSec` and `timelockDestSec` are durations; each is measured from the instant its lock transaction is mined on its chain. Because the source and destination locks are mined at different times (the procedure serialises them), the configured-duration inequality of HTLC-7 does not by itself guarantee the absolute-expiry inequality. To anchor both timelocks to a common reference, the destination-chain timelock MUST NOT begin counting before source-lock finality has been reached — equivalently, the destination lock MUST NOT be mined before source-lock finality. With this epoch anchoring, `timelockSourceSec > timelockDestSec + finality` (HTLC-7) implies `expiry_source > expiry_dest + finality` on absolute instants. Implementations MUST reject any route or schedule that mines (or could mine) the destination lock before source-lock finality, since such a route cannot establish the HTLC-7 guarantee. (HTLC-10) **Free-option disclosure.** The timelock asymmetry guarantees *liveness* (the payee can always claim the source once the payer reveals) but does NOT remove the inherent free option a basic HTLC swap grants the preimage-holding payer: after both legs are locked, the payer MAY decline to reveal and let both legs refund — having observed market movement during the lock window — at zero cost to themselves, while the payee's destination capital sits locked until the (shorter) destination timelock expires. This is a known property of HTLC atomic swaps, not specific to this rail, and v0.1 does NOT standardise an anti-option mechanism (bonded premium, timeout fee, stake). Listings sensitive to option abuse SHOULD prefer pay-cross-chain-liquidity-tank or require a bidder/payer stake; a payee MAY record a pattern of payer-abandoned legs via DACS-5.
**Reference-implementation status.** The DACS reference implementation (agent-commerce-demo, ~929 LOC) currently uses HTLC for fx-rfq cross-chain settlement: a real Solana Anchor program + Base Sepolia EVM HTLC contract, with lock / reveal / refund implemented end-to-end. This predates Native Bridges Phase 1 deployment; the reference will migrate to pay-cross-chain-liquidity-tank as Phase 1 stabilises. Two aspects of the current reference do not yet conform to this section and are tracked as implementation conformance items (app-layer orchestration only — no on-chain contract or SDK change): (i) its **reveal order** — it hands the preimage to the seller out-of-band and has the seller claim the source first, rather than the canonical payer-claims-destination-first order above (the canonical order removes a payer-loss risk if the payer goes offline after handover); and (ii) its **preimage generation** uses a plain CSPRNG value rather than the HTLC-5 HKDF derivation.
**Failure modes.** Source-side lock fails → permanent (no funds at risk yet). Destination-side lock never placed after the source lock → the payer reclaims the source via refund after timelock_source; no value moved. Destination-side timeout (the payer never claims the destination, so the preimage is never revealed) → both legs refund (payer reclaims source, payee reclaims destination); settlement-atomicity, benign. Preimage revealed but the payee's source-side claim has not landed → settlement-atomicity, **non-refundable asymmetric state** (the payer has already claimed the destination, so refunding the source to the payer would double-dip at the payee's expense — the source MUST NOT be refunded; see HTLC-9 below).
**Asymmetric-settlement evidence (normative).** (HTLC-9) The "preimage revealed but the payee's source-side claim has not landed" branch is materially different from the destination-side-timeout branch: in the timeout branch the payer never claimed the destination, the preimage was never revealed, and both legs refund (no value moved), whereas here the **payer** has already received value on the destination chain (the payer's destination claim succeeded; the preimage is public) and the **payee's** source-side claim has not yet landed. Refunding the source in this branch would return the payer's source funds to the payer — who has *already* claimed the destination — double-dipping at the payee's expense, so this state MUST NOT be modelled as a `refund` or `partial-refund` SettlementAmendment. To make the state representable and machine-distinguishable from the benign timeout: (a) the SettlementEvidence MUST set `outcome: "failure"` with a structured `reason` marker identifying the asymmetric state (RECOMMENDED literal `dest-revealed-source-unclaimed`); and (b) `paymentTxRefs` MUST include the `htlc-reveal` txRef (the payer's destination claim) so a consumer can prove the preimage was revealed on the destination chain. The open state is represented by the non-terminal `settle-asymmetric` session state (§10.3.1, ST-8), NOT by a terminal failure: the orchestrator watches for the payee's source claim until `expiry_source` (HTLC-7/HTLC-8). If the `htlc-claim` lands within that window, the phase anchors a superseding `outcome: "success"` SettlementEvidence (carrying `settlementFinality` and the full `htlc-lock` + `htlc-reveal` + `htlc-claim` txRef set) and the session resolves forward to `settle-completed` → `finalised` (terminal `completed`). If `expiry_source` passes with no source claim, the interim failure record stands and the session goes terminal `settle-failed` → `failed-counterparty` (the genuine unresolved loss, which DACS-X dispute may later address). No `correction` amendment is used — the ST-8 forward resolution replaces the former amendment-based closure, so the success path produces a normal `completed` bundle that DACS-5 reads directly. Until resolution the session is settled-asymmetric, not refunded; DACS-5 derivation weights a window-expired (terminal `failed-counterparty`) asymmetric loss strictly worse than a clean destination-side-timeout refund, since the payee is left owed source-chain value the payer has already taken its counterpart for.

#### 9.5.5 pay-cross-chain-liquidity-tank

Substrate-coordinated atomic settlement using pre-funded liquidity primitives. On Demos: Liquidity Tanks.
**Procedure.** Resolves rail and verifies asset.kind == "stablecoin-cross-chain" and network.kind == "cross-chain" with mechanism: "liquidity-tank"; selects liquidityTankIds matching (sourceChainId, destChainId); validates the route is in v0.1 supported scope (today: ETH Sepolia → Polygon Amoy, USDC, unidirectional); calls the substrate’s native bridge API — on Demos, constructs a BridgeOperation conforming to kynesyslabs/sdks/src/bridge/nativeBridgeTypes.ts with originChainType, destinationChainType, originAddress, destinationAddress, originAmount, originAsset, destinationAsset; submits via demos.bridge.submitBridgeOperation(…); the substrate’s validator shard executes lock-on-source and release-on-dest atomically (within the substrate’s consensus epoch); records the bridge_id (the 16-char hash that is the canonical end-to-end tracking handle); waits for BridgeOperation.status to transition "empty" → "pending" → "completed"; constructs SettlementEvidence with txRef of kind liquidity-tank including bridgeId, both lock and release tx hashes; anchors via SR-2; returns success.
**Trust model.** On Demos, Liquidity Tanks are operated by a rotating Demos validator shard under 2/3 BFT multisig with a 15-day deployer emergency-recovery path. This is "the operator is the substrate itself", not "no operator". The tank contracts (LiquidityTank.sol) are audited (600+ lines) and deployed to ETH Sepolia (0x7AE3A8B899BE0D9E9de51b81a9912C0CEE128d88) and Polygon Amoy (0x57cA16EeE7fbeC69BFD46E4806B5d91e173dd600). Other substrates implementing SR-5 via different mechanisms inherit their own substrate trust model; recipes referencing this rail MUST be evaluated against the relevant substrate’s security profile.
**Failure modes.** Tank insufficiency on dest → transient (retry after re-balancing); source-lock succeeds but substrate epoch interruption prevents dest-release → **substrate** (the dest-release is blocked by a substrate condition, not a counterparty fault; substrate-native recovery applies per SR-5 implementation — on Demos the 15-day emergency recovery is the backstop — and it resolves via ST-7 pause/resume, mapping to reputation-neutral `failed-substrate` on pause-timeout, NEVER `failed-counterparty`, since neither party is at fault for a substrate-recoverable lock); BridgeOperation.status == "failed" → permanent (deterministic rejection by tank shard).
**No mechanism substitution (normative).** The pinned rail's mechanism is binding. On tank insufficiency or capacity exhaustion the orchestrator MUST retry the pinned tank rail (transient) or fail the phase — it MUST NOT silently fall through to a different mechanism (e.g. `pay-cross-chain-htlc`). The produced `txRef.kind` MUST match the pinned rail (§9.14); a phase whose executed mechanism differs from the pinned rail MUST fail with errorClass: permanent. Silent substitution would violate the §9.13 pinned-rail rule and break the one-to-one phase↔txRef-kind correspondence. An implementation wanting HTLC fallback MUST express it as a distinct pinned rail / phase, not an implicit fallthrough.
**Evidence scope (v0.1).** Tank SettlementEvidence is **success-only**: both `lockTxHash` and `releaseTxHash` are present when the bridge reaches `completed`. A locked-but-not-yet-released state inside the recovery window is surfaced via the settlement-atomicity failure mode above and resolved by the substrate's native recovery path; v0.1 does **not** define a distinct *recovery-pending* evidence marker or state to machine-distinguish a recoverable lock from a terminal loss. A recovery-pending marker (a `recoveryDeadline` field and/or a settle-recovery-pending state, analogous to HTLC-9's open-state handling) is a roadmap item.

#### 9.5.6 pay-ap2

Payment via an AP2 mandate to a card network or banking provider.
**Procedure.** Resolves rail and verifies asset.kind == "fiat-via-ap2"; constructs an AP2 PaymentMandate conforming to FIDO Alliance AP2 spec (April 2026 onwards); the payer’s AP2-compatible wallet authorises the mandate; the mandate is submitted to the rail.network.providerEndpoint; receives a payment receipt and provider-side reference (e.g., Visa Direct payment id, Stripe PaymentIntent id); constructs SettlementEvidence with txRef of kind ap2 carrying mandateId, providerRef, and the AP2 `protocolVersion` (the wire version that produced the mandate/receipt, so historical evidence is re-validatable against the rules of its era — #27); anchors via SR-2; returns success.
**Failure modes.** Payer’s mandate authorisation refused → counterparty; provider declines the underlying payment (insufficient funds, fraud check, regulatory hold) → permanent; provider endpoint unavailable → transient; mandate revoked between authorisation and submission → counterparty.

#### 9.5.7 pay-x402

Payment via x402 HTTP 402 micropayment to an HTTP resource.
**Procedure.** Resolves rail and verifies network.kind == "x402-resource"; constructs an x402 payment payload (signed authorisation per x402 spec); submits the GET request to the resource with x402 headers; receives the resource response and an x402 receipt; reads the on-chain settlement transaction hash from the x402 `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header (x402 settles a gasless USDC transfer on its settlement chain, e.g. Base); constructs SettlementEvidence with txRef of kind x402 carrying httpResource, paymentReceiptHash (sha256 of the receipt), the x402 `protocolVersion` (#27), and — whenever the facilitator returns it (the normal case) — the on-chain `settlementTxHash` + `chainId`. A record carrying `settlementTxHash`/`chainId` is **chain-verifiable directly against the settlement chain, exactly like the `evm` rail** — this is the primary audit path; the receipt hash is supplementary. The handler MUST populate `settlementTxHash`/`chainId` when the facilitator returns them. Anchors via SR-2; returns success.
**What pay-x402 adds beyond bare x402.** A direct x402 transaction produces a receipt the client and server hold off-chain; there is no anchored audit trail and the transaction is not bound to a DACS session. pay-x402 binds the x402 transaction into a DACS session by: (a) producing a SettlementEvidence record carrying the on-chain `settlementTxHash` (chain-verifiable against the settlement chain, like the `evm` rail) plus the x402 receipt hash, anchored via SR-2 — the receipt itself remains off-chain but its hash, the settlement tx, and the protocol version become part of the on-chain bundle; (b) tying the x402 transaction to a specific DACS-3 AgreementDocument via the session’s jobId; (c) making the x402 transaction available to DACS-5 reputation derivation and ERC-8004 publication. For pure HTTP-402 use cases that do not need a session bundle, bare x402 is appropriate; pay-x402 is the right wrapper when the x402 transaction participates in a multi-stage agent commerce lifecycle.
**Failure modes.** Server-side x402 endpoint rejects (insufficient payment, unsupported scheme) → counterparty; HTTP error after payment submitted → transient (retry with idempotency key); payment-receipt signature invalid → permanent.

### 9.6 Delivery phases

The v0.1 closed set. Each consumes the agreement’s DeliverableRef and produces SettlementEvidence.

#### 9.6.1 deliver-storage-program

Seller writes a Storage Program (SR-2) containing the deliverable payload. Address derived from jobId.
**Procedure.** Validates agreement.terms.deliverable.deliverableType == "storage-program"; seller constructs the deliverable payload conforming to deliverable.schemaUrl (if specified); writes a Storage Program at address dacs4:deliverable:{jobId} with the payload as value; computes contentHash = sha256(canonical_payload); constructs SettlementEvidence with deliverableContentHash = contentHash, deliverableAnchor = {kind: "storage-program", locator: …}; anchors via SR-2; returns success.
**Soft limit.** Storage Programs have a 128 KB cap. Larger payloads MUST use the extended-pointer pattern: the Storage Program at the canonical address contains a pointer record { externalUrl, externalContentHash, segmentRefs[]? }; the actual payload is hosted externally; the externalContentHash binds it. The buyer fetches the pointer, then fetches the payload, then verifies the hash.

#### 9.6.2 deliver-entitlement

Seller issues an EntitlementRecord granting the buyer time-bound access to a service.
**Procedure.** Validates agreement.terms.deliverable.deliverableType == "entitlement"; resolves the entitlement parameters (`durationSec`, `renewable`) from the **DeliverableSpec** — the listing's `offering.deliverable`, bound to the agreement by the §8.5.2 hash check — NOT from `agreement.terms.deliverable`, which is a `DeliverableRef` carrying only `deliverableType` / `hash` / `schemaUrl?` and none of these fields; seller constructs the EntitlementRecord:

```
type EntitlementRecord = {

  entitlementVersion: "1"

  jobId: string

  grantee: ClaimReference              // buyer primary claim

  grantor: ClaimReference               // seller primary claim

  startsAt: number                     // unix ms

  endsAt: number                       // unix ms; computed from the entitlement DeliverableSpec's durationSec (listing offering.deliverable, hash-bound per §8.5.2)

  scope: { service: string; tier?: string; quotas?: Record<string, number> }

  serviceEndpoint?: string             // URL where the grantee exercises the entitlement; SHOULD be present for callable services so the record is a self-contained receipt

  renewable: boolean

  renewalSeq: number                   // 0 for the original grant; incremented per renewal (address discriminator)

  signature: ComponentSignature

}
```

Seller signs the EntitlementRecord over the domain-separated payload "dacs-entitlement:v1:" || sha256(canonical_JCS(record_without_signature)) per chapter 7§7.7; anchors the EntitlementRecord via SR-2 at dacs4:entitlement:{jobId}:{renewalSeq} (renewalSeq = 0 for the original grant); constructs SettlementEvidence; returns success. Buyer presents the EntitlementRecord (or its hash + anchor) at the record's `serviceEndpoint` to access the entitled service — the record is a self-contained receipt (it names the grantee, the scope, the validity window, and where to exercise it), so the buyer needs nothing beyond the record itself. The service endpoint verifies the signature and anchor, checks now is within [startsAt, endsAt], and serves accordingly. `serviceEndpoint` carries *where* to access; how an access **credential / token** is delivered (vs. presenting the record itself as the bearer proof) is an out-of-band auth concern not specified in v0.1 — see roadmap.
**Renewal.** If renewable: true and the buyer re-pays before endsAt, the seller MAY issue a new EntitlementRecord with extended endsAt, the same jobId, and an **incremented renewalSeq**, anchored at dacs4:entitlement:{jobId}:{renewalSeq}. The renewalSeq discriminator gives each renewal a distinct SR-2 address so it does not collide with or overwrite the original grant (the address is otherwise fully determined by jobId on immutable content-addressed storage). A consumer resolves the current grant by reading the highest renewalSeq present for the jobId.

#### 9.6.3 deliver-attested-payload

Seller delivers a payload whose authenticity is attested via DACS-2 (e.g., the payload is a TLS-attested data fetch).
**Procedure.** Validates agreement.terms.deliverable.deliverableType == "attested-payload"; seller performs the underlying fetch / computation; produces a DACS-2 attestation over the result (using the recipe specified in the attested-payload DeliverableSpec's verificationMethod, resolved from the listing's offering.deliverable per §8.5.2 — not from the DeliverableRef in agreement.terms.deliverable); writes the payload + attestation reference into a Storage Program at dacs4:deliverable:{jobId}; constructs SettlementEvidence carrying deliverableContentHash, deliverableAnchor, and attestationRef pointing at the DACS-2 attestation; anchors via SR-2; returns success.

### 9.7 Settlement evidence

The uniform record produced by every payment and delivery phase. Anchored on the substrate; referenced by DACS-5.

```
type SettlementEvidence = {

  evidenceVersion: "1"

  jobId: string

  phase: PaymentPhaseType | DeliveryPhaseType

  outcome: "success" | "failure"

  reason?: string                              // when outcome == "failure"

  // Payment evidence

  paymentTxRefs?: ChainTxRef[]

  paymentAmount?: PriceTerm                    // actual settled amount; REQUIRED on any success-outcome evidence record (AMEND-3 is evaluated against it); MAY be absent only on failure-outcome records

  paymentFee?: PriceTerm                       // chain or provider fee

  // Delivery evidence

  deliverableContentHash?: string

  deliverableAnchor?: { kind: string; locator: string }

  attestationRef?: AttestationRef              // for deliver-attested-payload

  // Finality model for this settlement: REQUIRED on a success-outcome payment evidence record (PC-6); absent on delivery evidence and on failure-outcome payment evidence

  settlementFinality?: SettlementFinalityRecord

  // Optional cross-references

  amendmentRefs?: AttestationRef[]             // refunds / partial refunds linked here

  observedAt: number                           // unix ms

  signature: ComponentSignature                // signer is the phase orchestrator

}

// Records the finality model applied when the phase handler declared the payment confirmed.
// Populated by payment phases only (pay-evm-erc20, pay-solana-spl, pay-cross-chain-htlc,
// pay-cross-chain-liquidity-tank, pay-ap2, pay-x402); delivery phases MUST omit it.
type SettlementFinalityRecord = {

  model: "block-depth"          // EVM / UTXO: wait for N blocks (finalityBlocks from rail.parameters)
       | "commitment-level"     // Solana: wait for a named commitment (commitmentLevel from rail.parameters)
       | "provider-receipt"     // Fiat (AP2); also x402 ONLY in the fallback case where the facilitator returns no settlement tx — normally x402 uses "block-depth" on its settlement chain (the settlementTxHash, #28)
       | "htlc-reveal"          // Cross-chain HTLC: the payee's source-side claim (htlc-claim) landed against the revealed preimage — the decisive success tx; the payer's destination claim revealed the preimage earlier. (Model token retained as "htlc-reveal" for back-compat.)
       | "liquidity-tank"       // Native bridge liquidity-tank: bridge status transitions to "completed"

  // For model == "block-depth": the number of blocks waited before declaring confirmation.
  // Sourced from rail.parameters.finalityBlocks; echoed here so the evidence record is self-describing.
  finalityBlocks?: number

  // For model == "commitment-level": the Solana commitment level accepted.
  // Sourced from rail.parameters.commitmentLevel; echoed here so the evidence record is self-describing.
  finalityCommitmentLevel?: "processed" | "confirmed" | "finalized"

  // Wall-clock unix ms at which the finality condition was observed to be met.
  // For block-depth: block timestamp of the Nth confirmation block.
  // For commitment-level: timestamp at which the commitment level was reached.
  // For provider-receipt / htlc-reveal / liquidity-tank: timestamp of the decisive event
  // (for htlc-reveal: the payee's source-side htlc-claim confirmation — the same event that flips outcome to success).
  finalityObservedAt: number

}

type PaymentPhaseType = "pay-evm-erc20" | "pay-solana-spl"

                      | "pay-cross-chain-htlc" | "pay-cross-chain-liquidity-tank"

                      | "pay-ap2" | "pay-x402"

type DeliveryPhaseType = "deliver-storage-program" | "deliver-entitlement" | "deliver-attested-payload"

type ComponentSignature = {

  algorithm: "ed25519" | "ecdsa-secp256k1" | "sr1-aggregate"

  signer: ClaimReference                       // primary claim of the signing party; per-artifact role is given in each record's inline comment (e.g. phase orchestrator, refunding party, grantor)

  value: string                                // signature over the domain-separated payload defined for the artifact (chapter 7§7.7)

}
```

Every anchored record that carries a `signature: ComponentSignature` field MUST populate it with this shape. The `signer` MUST be a ClaimReference whose role is fixed by the artifact's inline comment, and `value` MUST be the signature over that artifact's domain-separated payload as defined in its section.

Canonical form is RFC 8785 JCS of the SettlementEvidence with the signature field omitted. Evidence hash is sha256(canonical_form), hex-encoded. The signature is computed over the domain-separated payload per chapter 7§7.7:
signed_bytes := "dacs-evidence:v1:" || evidence_hash

#### 9.7.1 Refunds and partial refunds

Refunds are not a separate phase type in v0.1. A refund is modelled as a SettlementAmendment record anchored after the original SettlementEvidence:

```
type SettlementAmendment = {

  amendmentVersion: "1"

  jobId: string

  amendsEvidenceRef: AttestationRef    // points to the SettlementEvidence being amended

  amendmentType: "refund" | "partial-refund" | "correction"

  refundAmount?: PriceTerm

  refundTxRefs?: ChainTxRef[]

  reason: string

  observedAt: number

  signature: ComponentSignature        // signed by the refunding party (typically seller)

}
```

SettlementAmendment is anchored via SR-2 at dacs4:amendment:{jobId}:{evidenceHash}:{amendmentIndex}. The amendment signature is computed over the domain-separated payload "dacs-amendment:v1:" || sha256(canonical_JCS(amendment_without_signature)) per chapter 7§7.7. The DACS-5 session record includes amendments in the bundle if they arrive before bundle finalisation.

**Amendment validity.** An amendment is meaningless unless it binds to a real, successful settlement; without the following constraints a refund can anchor against a non-existent or failure-outcome evidence record, or exceed the amount that actually settled, feeding DACS-5 reputation logic records it cannot trust. (AMEND-1) `amendsEvidenceRef` MUST resolve to an anchored SettlementEvidence whose `jobId` equals the amendment’s `jobId`. (AMEND-2) An amendment of `amendmentType` `refund` or `partial-refund` MUST reference an evidence record whose `outcome == "success"`; a settlement-atomicity failure (no funds moved) is unwound on the rail’s refund path (e.g. the HTLC timelock-refund path per §9.5.4), NEVER via a refund amendment. A `correction` records a non-financial fix to a prior evidence record and MUST NOT carry `refundAmount`. (AMEND-3) The sum of `refundAmount` across all amendments referencing a single evidence record MUST NOT exceed that record’s `paymentAmount`, compared currency-matched per the PriceTerm. v0.1 REQUIRES refunds in the settled currency: a `refundAmount.currency` that differs from the amended evidence's `paymentAmount.currency` makes the AMEND-3 bound non-evaluable and MUST be flagged per AMEND-4 (cross-currency refunds are out of scope for v0.1 — a roadmap candidate). (AMEND-4) Bundle assembly MUST reject — or, where a complete audit trail is preferred, flag — any amendment that violates AMEND-1 through AMEND-3 rather than silently including it; a flagged amendment MUST NOT be treated as a valid unwind by DACS-5 reputation derivation.

### 9.8 Cross-chain atomic settlement (SR-5)

Atomic settlement across chains requires SR-5: either substrate-native cross-chain transactions, HTLC contracts on participating chains, or pre-funded liquidity primitives (Liquidity Tanks on Demos).
**Atomicity guarantee.** SR-5 implementations MUST ensure: payment on chain A and value-receipt on chain B succeed together; or both refund / never-take-effect within a bounded time. "Bounded time" is realisation-specific: HTLC — the timelock parameter; Liquidity Tank — the substrate’s consensus epoch (Demos: typically seconds; emergency-recovery backstop: 15 days); substrate-native cross-chain — atomically within the substrate transaction. One branch falls outside the "both refund" arm by construction: the HTLC reveal-succeeded / source-claim-pending state (§9.5.4, HTLC-9), where the payer has already received value on the destination chain and refunding the source would let the payer double-dip at the payee's expense. SR-5 implementations MUST surface this state as the asymmetric-settlement evidence defined in HTLC-9 (not as a refund) and resolve it through the non-terminal `settle-asymmetric` state (§10.3.1, ST-8) — an `htlc-claim` within the `expiry_source` window resolves forward to a `completed` outcome; window expiry yields a terminal `failed-counterparty`. This is the bounded exception to the refund arm, not a hole in atomicity.
**Cross-chain messaging vs settlement.** Cross-chain messaging protocols (Wormhole, LayerZero, Hyperlane, CCIP, Axelar, IBC) carry arbitrary message payloads between chains; they are message-passing primitives. SR-5 is settlement-atomicity: the property that a payment on chain A and a value-receipt on chain B happen together or not at all. A messaging protocol CAN be composed with SR-5 (e.g., a Liquidity Tank implementation may use a messaging protocol internally), but it is NOT itself SR-5. DACS-4 does not register messaging protocols as first-class rails for this reason — the rail surface is settlement, and a "message delivered" outcome does not imply a "value settled" outcome. Substrates whose SR-5 implementation depends on a specific messaging protocol MUST disclose this in the rail definition; the trust model then inherits both the messaging protocol’s and the SR-5 mechanism’s assumptions.
**Choosing a rail.** Cost: HTLC pays gas on two chains; Liquidity Tank typically pays gas only on dest (source-side lock is operator-paid in tank schemes that subsidise gas, including Demos’s current model). Latency: HTLC — source finality + dest finality + claim round-trip (minutes typically); Liquidity Tank — substrate epoch (seconds on Demos). Trust: HTLC — cryptographic / chain consensus only; Liquidity Tank — substrate operator. Listings selecting cross-chain rails SHOULD declare the trust expectations in terms.additionalTerms.

### 9.9 Pipeline composition

A listing’s pipeline declares the order of payment and delivery phases. Common patterns:

- **Pay-then-deliver** (default for trusted seller; AP2 mandate, x402 micropayment): [pay-*, deliver-*].
- **Deliver-then-pay** (for cheap delivery / expensive verification; e.g. a free data preview + paid full fetch): [deliver-*, pay-*]. Risk shifts to seller.
- **Escrow with delivery-gate** (lock → deliver → release): the v0.1 `pay-cross-chain-htlc` handler is an **atomic swap** (§9.5.4) — it has no mid-lock suspension point, so it cannot run a `deliver-*` phase *between* lock and reveal. An escrow that gates release on delivery is therefore **not expressible in v0.1** and is reserved for a future job-escrow rail (ERC-8183 is the natural home — see roadmap). v0.1 listings needing escrow-like risk shifting use deliver-then-pay or pay-then-deliver with the counterparty risk that implies.
- **Streamed entitlement / subscription**: a multi-tranche subscription is conceptually a **sequence of independent sessions** — a fresh jobId is a *new session*, not a loop within one pipeline (§7.5/§10.3: one pipeline = one jobId). Continuous-flow / subscription settlement, including any cross-session correlation identifier, is **out of scope for v0.1** (§11.2.4; see roadmap). A v0.1 listing models each tranche as its own session.

**Conformance.** (PIPE-1) A pipeline MUST contain at least one deliver-* phase. A pipeline MAY contain **zero** pay-* phases — the **intake-only / settled-out-of-band** pattern that §6.3.4(8) names (RFP intake, reverse auctions where the bid is the commitment, free services gated by reputation, sealed-bid procurements settled out-of-band); if a pipeline contains any pay-* phase, the acceptedRails rule of §6.3.4(8) applies. (This reconciles PIPE-1 with §6.3.4(8): a reader of either chapter reaches the same accept decision for a pay-less pipeline — earlier drafts required at-least-one-pay, contradicting §6.3.4(8).) (PIPE-2) Phase ordering MUST be deterministic; the listing’s declared order is normative. (PIPE-3) If a pay-*phase is followed by a deliver-* phase, the deliver-*phase MUST NOT execute until the pay-* phase returns ok: true. (PIPE-4) If a deliver-*phase is followed by a pay-* phase, the pay-*phase MUST NOT execute until the deliver-* phase returns ok: true. (PIPE-5) Pipelines MAY repeat a phase; each invocation produces independent SettlementEvidence. In v0.1 each repeated pay-* invocation settles the **same** agreement price (`PaymentPhaseInput.amount` = `agreement.terms.price`) — the payment contract carries no per-phase amount override, fee, or split, so a **fee-split** (distinct amounts to distinct payees, e.g. buyer + platform fee) is NOT representable in v0.1 and is a roadmap item (fee-split / multi-payee settlement model). Repetition is for genuinely identical settlements, not for splitting one price across payees.

### 9.10 Conformance summary

| Role | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Rail author | RD-1 through RD-5 |
| Payment phase handler | PC-1 through PC-6; phase-specific procedure |
| Delivery phase handler | §9.6 per-kind procedure; SettlementEvidence emission |
| Pipeline executor | PIPE-1 through PIPE-5 |
| SettlementEvidence consumer | Canonical hash recomputation; signature validation; amendment chain following |

### 9.11 Rationale

**Closed rail registry vs open.** Open rail registries make conformance untestable: a listing could declare a rail no orchestrator implements. The closed v0.1 set covers the dominant settlement paths in production; new rails ship via the DACS-4 version process under the registry steward (currently KyneSys Labs).
**Uniform SettlementEvidence vs rail-specific evidence shapes.** Rail-specific shapes would force every downstream consumer (DACS-5, auditors, analytics) to handle N shapes. The uniform shape with a discriminated txRefs union keeps consumption simple while preserving per-rail detail.
**Payment and delivery as separate phases vs combined.** Decoupling lets listings compose risk however the seller deems safe: pay-then-deliver for trusted sellers, deliver-then-pay where risk shifts to the seller. A combined phase would force every listing into one risk model. (Escrow-with-delivery-gate and streamed subscriptions are named in §9.9 as roadmap, not v0.1 patterns.)
**HTLC and Liquidity Tank as parallel first-class rails.** HTLC is the only fully trust-minimised cross-chain primitive that ships today across heterogeneous chains; the reference implementation already runs on it. Liquidity Tanks are faster and cheaper but trust the substrate operator. Both have legitimate use cases; v0.1 ships both rather than picking a winner.
**AP2 and x402 as rails vs separate stages.** AP2 and x402 are payment protocols; they fit naturally as rails with their own phase handlers. Modelling them as separate stages would duplicate everything DACS-4 already does (evidence, conformance, error classification) for no gain.
**Refunds as amendments vs separate phases.** Refunds happen post-settlement and may arrive long after the original phase has completed. Modelling them as out-of-band amendments anchored after the original evidence lets sessions close normally even when refunds straggle in. The amendment is included in the bundle if present at bundle time.
**Native bridge / Liquidity Tank trust model disclosure.** Honest disclosure of "operated by a rotating Demos validator shard under 2/3 BFT multisig with 15-day emergency recovery" is the right default. Users picking this rail are choosing speed + cost over trust-minimisation, and the recipe makes that trade-off explicit. Substrates with different SR-5 realisations inherit their own trust models and MUST disclose them similarly.

### 9.12 Backwards compatibility

**ERC-20.** pay-evm-erc20 uses the standard ERC-20 transfer interface; any compliant ERC-20 token works. The rail registry pins specific tokens (e.g. USDC) per chain to avoid scam-token substitution.
**SPL.** pay-solana-spl uses the standard SPL TransferChecked instruction; any compliant SPL token works. The rail registry pins specific mints per cluster.
**HTLC contracts.** Generic HTLC pattern; reference HTLC contracts in the DACS reference implementation are deployed on Base Sepolia and Solana devnet. Other deployments are compatible if they implement lock/claim/refund with the same hashlock-and-timelock semantics.
**AP2.** Compatible with AP2 spec as donated to the FIDO Alliance in April 2026 and subsequent FIDO Alliance versions. Per-provider rail entries (ap2:visa-direct, ap2:mastercard-send, ap2:stripe-paymentintents) pin provider-specific parameters.
**x402.** Compatible with x402 spec as published by Coinbase / Cloudflare / Anthropic. The pay-x402 rail handler is provider-agnostic; specific x402 servers may add parameters via the generic parameters field.
**ERC-8183 escrow (future).** ERC-8183 introduces an EVM-native escrow primitive for job-style transactions. A future v0.2 rail (pay-evm-erc8183) will compose ERC-8183 escrow with DACS-4 evidence; v0.1 does not include it.
**Substrate-native bridges (Demos Liquidity Tanks).** pay-cross-chain-liquidity-tank on Demos uses Liquidity Tanks per the SDK shape at kynesyslabs/sdks/src/bridge/nativeBridgeTypes.ts. Other substrates implementing SR-5 via native cross-chain transactions (e.g. Polkadot XCM) MAY add their own rails under the cross-chain-liquidity-tank rail type with substrate-specific parameters.

### 9.13 Security considerations

**Re-entrancy on EVM rails.** *Threat:* a malicious ERC-20 hook re-enters the orchestrator during pay-evm-erc20 settlement. *Mitigation:* phase handlers MUST be re-entrancy-safe; the SettlementEvidence MUST be anchored only after the chain transaction is confirmed at finality.
**MEV / front-running on payment txs.** *Threat:* a public-mempool payment can be front-run by MEV bots. *Mitigation:* rail.parameters MAY specify Flashbots-style private mempools or rate-limited public submission. Payment phases SHOULD support submitting via private mempools when available. For high-stakes settlements, cross-chain-liquidity-tank avoids public-mempool exposure entirely.
**Cross-chain settlement-atomicity failure.** *Threat:* HTLC source-lock succeeds but dest-claim never happens; payer’s funds are locked. *Mitigation:* HTLC timelocks let payer reclaim after expiry. Phase handlers MUST track lock expiry and invoke refund automatically. settlement-atomicity error class flags this for DACS-5 reputation logic.
**Liquidity Tank operator compromise.** *Threat:* the substrate validator shard operating Liquidity Tanks is compromised. *Mitigation:* the substrate’s security model (2/3 BFT multisig on Demos, 15-day emergency-recovery on Demos) is the floor. Listings handling high-stakes flows over Liquidity Tanks SHOULD evaluate the substrate’s validator-shard security; for the highest stakes, HTLC is recommended.
**AP2 mandate replay.** *Threat:* an old AP2 mandate is replayed against the provider. *Mitigation:* AP2 mandates include a nonce and an expiry; the provider rejects replays. DACS-4 inherits AP2’s anti-replay properties.
**x402 payment-receipt forgery.** *Threat:* a server claims payment was received when it was not. *Mitigation:* x402 settles on-chain (a gasless USDC transfer on its settlement chain), so the **primary audit is verifying the anchored `settlementTxHash` against that chain** — exactly like the `evm` rail, and not forgeable by the server or facilitator. The x402 receipt is additionally facilitator-signed; where a `settlementTxHash` is unavailable (a facilitator that does not return it), verification falls back to the facilitator-attested receipt and the audit guarantee for that record is processor-attested rather than chain-verified. Buyer-side x402 wallets SHOULD maintain a local record of submitted payments to detect contested cases.
**Delivery non-delivery.** *Threat:* seller signals payment received, never delivers. *Mitigation:* outside DACS-4’s remit; this is a DACS-3 / DACS-5 issue (the deliver-* phase MUST return ok: false on missing deliverable; DACS-5 records the failure; reputation impact accrues). Listings handling expensive non-recoverable deliveries SHOULD use escrow pipelines (pay-cross-chain-htlc) where the seller’s payment is contingent on demonstrable delivery.
**Refund laundering.** *Threat:* sellers issue refunds to clean up failed deliveries without recording failure. *Mitigation:* SettlementAmendment is anchored and signed; DACS-5 bundles include amendments; the audit trail shows both the original (apparently successful) payment and the (later) refund. Reputation derivation in DACS-5 MUST treat refunded sessions appropriately. The inverse attack — a refund amendment anchored against a non-existent or failure-outcome evidence record, or an over-refund beyond the settled amount, fabricating a good-faith unwind or a counterparty-loss signal — is guarded by the AMEND-1 through AMEND-4 amendment-validity constraints in §9.7.1.
**Decimal-overflow in cross-decimal-system pay paths.** *Threat:* converting a fiat-denominated amount.amount to on-chain integer units overflows or rounds incorrectly. *Mitigation:* the §9.5.2 / §9.5.3 payment procedures mandate string-decimal arithmetic with no float (e.g. `amount.amount * 10^decimals` computed as string-decimal multiplication), and `PriceTerm.amount` is canonical decimal per CD-1 (§8.5.1). Rail authors MUST specify decimals exactly; phase handlers MUST validate amount.amount precision against rail.asset.decimals (excess precision is an error).
**Pinned-rail vs latest-rail at settle time.** *Threat:* the rail registry changes between agreement commit and settle execution. *Mitigation:* the rail is pinned at session start (per railRegistryVersion in SessionContext). Settle MUST use the pinned rail definition, even if the registry has since superseded it.

## Chapter 10 — DACS-5: Verify

**Stage:** Verify (5th of 5). **Status:** Draft (part of DACS v0.1). **Depends on:** SR-1 (preferred for cross-substrate primary-claim keying), SR-2 (required for bundle anchoring); composes with ERC-8004 reputation registry as an OPTIONAL publication surface. **Used by:** all subsequent DACS-1 sessions (reputation lookups), external auditors and regulators.

### 10.1 Abstract

DACS-5 specifies how a completed session is anchored, signed, and converted into a reputation signal. It defines:

- A **session record schema** — the live, mutable state document the orchestrator maintains while a session runs. Holds phase results, error classifications, and the running event log. Off-chain by default.
- An **attestation bundle format** — the frozen end-of-session artifact, signed by both parties, anchored via SR-2. Bundles are the audit unit.
- A **session-state machine** — deterministic, forward-only state transitions from `draft` to one of the terminal states (`finalised`, the `*-failed` states, `failed-substrate`, or the `aborted-by-*` states), enumerated as a normative transition table in §10.3.1.
- A **reputation derivation algorithm** — a deterministic, per-primary-claim function from a set of bundles to a small set of headline metrics (completion rate, dispute rate, average rating, observed transactional volume).
- An **optional rate phase** — a counterparty rating phase that produces a RatingRecord referenced from the bundle.
- An **ERC-8004 publication surface** — the recommended mapping from DACS-5 reputation metrics to ERC-8004 reputation/validation registry entries.

Reputation is keyed against the **primary identity claim** of the bundle, not against a wallet, signing key, or session pubkey. This prevents low-tier reputation from laundering into high-tier presentations.

### 10.2 Motivation

The Verify stage answers three questions that no other stage answers: *did this transaction actually happen the way the parties say it did?* (a cryptographic, anchored audit trail anyone can inspect); *what did each party think of the other?* (a structured rating from one party about another); *how does this transaction feed into a counterparty’s future reputation?* (a deterministic update rule applied to the bundle of metrics keyed against the party’s primary claim).
Existing open standards address none of these end-to-end. ERC-8004 specifies on-chain reputation entries but says nothing about how the underlying transactions are evidenced. Off-chain rating systems (review-style ratings on marketplaces) exist but are operator-controlled and not portable across platforms. Audit-log standards (e.g., RFC 5424 syslog, OpenTelemetry traces) handle observability but not cryptographic non-repudiation across counterparties.
DACS-5 fills these gaps with three layered artifacts: the session record (working state, the orchestrator’s book), the attestation bundle (the closed audit unit, anchored), and the reputation derivation (the public-facing summary). Each layer is anchored, signed, and verifiable against the earlier stages’ outputs.
A separate concern: **reputation keying**. A party that holds a $0.01 micropayment-tier signing key and accumulates a great reputation should not be able to laundered that into an institutional LEI presentation. DACS-5 keys reputation against the bundle’s primary claim, with separate accumulations per primary-claim tier. The same wallet may hold three primary claims (key:…, did:…, lei:…); each accumulates its own reputation. The DACS-5 derivation algorithm partitions by primary claim and produces tier-distinct metrics.

### 10.3 Session record

The live, mutable state document an orchestrator maintains during a session.

```
type SessionRecord = {

  recordVersion: "1"

  jobId: string                              // ULID or substrate-equivalent

  state: SessionState

  listingRef: { listingId: string; version: number; contentHash: string }

  parties: SessionParty[]                    // buyer + seller (+ optionally orchestrator)

  pipeline: PhaseStep[]

  phaseResults: PhaseEntry[]                 // one per executed phase

  startedAt: number                          // unix ms

  lastUpdatedAt: number

  endedAt?: number                           // set on terminal state

  recipeRegistryVersion: number              // DACS-2 registry pinned at session start

  railRegistryVersion: number                // DACS-4 registry pinned at session start

  amendments?: AttestationRef[]              // refunds and other amendments

}

type SessionState =

  | "draft"

  | "vet-pending" | "vet-completed" | "vet-failed"

  | "negotiate-pending" | "negotiate-completed" | "negotiate-failed"

  | "commit-pending" | "commit-completed" | "commit-failed"

  | "settle-pending" | "settle-asymmetric" | "settle-completed" | "settle-failed"

  | "rate-pending" | "rate-completed"

  | "finalised"

  | "aborted-by-self" | "aborted-by-other"

  | "substrate-failure-paused" | "failed-substrate"

type SessionParty = {

  role: "buyer" | "seller" | "orchestrator"

  bundleHash: string                         // sha256 of the verified IdentityBundle

  primaryClaim: ClaimReference               // bundle.presentedBy

  vetRecordRef?: AttestationRef              // post-Vet

}

type PhaseEntry = {

  index: number                              // position in pipeline

  step: PhaseStep

  invokedAt: number

  result: PhaseHandlerResult

  contextDelta: Record<string, unknown>      // merged into running context

}
```

#### 10.3.1 State transitions

Transitions are deterministic and forward-only. The orchestrator advances state only when the corresponding phase returns `ok: true`; on phase `ok: false` it transitions to that phase’s `*-failed` state and classifies per the phase’s `errorClass`. The only permitted non-forward transition is resume from `substrate-failure-paused` (ST-7 below). New sessions get new jobIds; a failed/aborted session is never reopened.

**Transition table (normative).** The following table enumerates every legal `(from → to)` pair. A transition not listed is illegal; a conformant orchestrator MUST NOT perform it, and a §14.5 conformance run tests exactly this pair-set.

| From | To (legal next states) | Trigger |
|------|------------------------|---------|
| `draft` | `vet-pending` | session opens; first phase scheduled |
| `vet-pending` | `vet-completed` \| `vet-failed` \| `substrate-failure-paused` \| `aborted-by-self` \| `aborted-by-other` | Vet phase result |
| `vet-completed` | `negotiate-pending` | next phase scheduled |
| `negotiate-pending` | `negotiate-completed` \| `negotiate-failed` \| `substrate-failure-paused` \| `aborted-by-self` \| `aborted-by-other` | Negotiate phase result |
| `negotiate-completed` | `commit-pending` | next phase scheduled |
| `commit-pending` | `commit-completed` \| `commit-failed` \| `substrate-failure-paused` \| `aborted-by-self` \| `aborted-by-other` | commit-agreement result |
| `commit-completed` | `settle-pending` | next phase scheduled |
| `settle-pending` | `settle-completed` \| `settle-asymmetric` \| `settle-failed` \| `substrate-failure-paused` \| `aborted-by-self` \| `aborted-by-other` | Settle phase result |
| `settle-asymmetric` | `settle-completed` \| `settle-failed` | ST-8 (cross-chain asymmetric open state) |
| `settle-completed` | `rate-pending` (pipeline has a rate phase) \| `finalised` (no rate phase) | ST-4 |
| `rate-pending` | `rate-completed` \| `finalised` | ST-5 |
| `rate-completed` | `finalised` | rate phase done |
| `substrate-failure-paused` | the `*-pending` state it paused from \| `failed-substrate` | ST-7 |

**Rules:**

- (ST-1) **Forward-only.** Except for ST-7 resume, a transition MUST move toward a terminal state per the table. The orchestrator MUST NOT re-enter an earlier `*-pending` state (e.g. negotiate after commit).
- (ST-2) **Phase failure.** A phase returning `ok: false` MUST transition to that phase’s `*-failed` state, classified by the phase’s `errorClass`. A commit-agreement rejection (a CA-3 re-commitment for an already-anchored jobId, or an agreement failing the §8.5.2 listing-conformance checks) is a `commit-pending → commit-failed` transition (forward-only; it MUST NOT be folded back into `negotiate-failed`).
- (ST-3) **Abort.** At any `*-pending` state a party MAY withdraw, or decline to co-sign, before the phase reaches a `*-completed`/`*-failed` result; doing so terminates the session in an abort state. Withdrawing before being bound is a legitimate exercise of a party’s right to decline — it is NOT a protocol violation, and an abort outcome is therefore distinct from a `*-failed` performance failure. The abort state is recorded from the perspective of the party anchoring the bundle (per §10.4.3 / §10.11): the withdrawing party’s own bundle records `aborted-by-self`; the non-withdrawing party’s bundle records `aborted-by-other`. (A withdrawing party need not anchor a bundle at all; the §10.11 bundle-suppression rule lets the non-withdrawing party’s single-signed `aborted-by-other` bundle stand.) How an abort bears on reputation is governed by §10.5 / §10.11, not by this transition rule. Abort states are terminal.
- (ST-4) **Rate branch.** `settle-completed` transitions to `rate-pending` iff the listing pipeline contains a rate phase; otherwise directly to `finalised`.
- (ST-5) **Rate is non-fatal.** A rate phase that fails or is declined does NOT fail the session: `rate-pending` transitions to `finalised` regardless of rate outcome (per §10.6, absence of a rating does not block bundle production). There is deliberately no `rate-failed` state. A rate step parameter `{required: true}` is advisory for the rater’s own policy; it MUST NOT change this transition.
- (ST-6) **Terminal states.** The terminal states are exactly: `finalised`, `vet-failed`, `negotiate-failed`, `commit-failed`, `settle-failed`, `failed-substrate`, `aborted-by-self`, `aborted-by-other`. `SessionRecord.endedAt` MUST be set on entry to any terminal state, and a bundle MUST be produced (§10.4.3). `draft`, all `*-pending`, all non-failed `*-completed`, `rate-pending`, `settle-asymmetric`, and `substrate-failure-paused` are non-terminal.
- (ST-7) **Substrate-failure pause & resume.** On `errorClass: "substrate"` (SR-2 or SR-3 unavailable, etc.) at any `*-pending` state, the orchestrator MAY transition to `substrate-failure-paused`, recording the paused-from `*-pending` state, and retry per a backoff schedule. On a successful retry the session resumes to the recorded `*-pending` state (the one permitted non-forward transition); the resumed phase MUST be idempotent or safe to re-drive (a phase that may have already broadcast an external effect — e.g. a pay-* phase — MUST check for that effect before re-issuing it). Pauses MUST be time-bounded; after a per-listing maximum pause (default 3600 seconds) the session MUST transition to `failed-substrate` (terminal). A successful resume clears the substrate condition: a subsequent failure of the resumed (or any later) phase is classified solely by that phase's own `errorClass`, independent of the prior `substrate` pause or pause-cycle count. **Precedence over abort.** If, at a `*-pending` state, a party withdrawal/decline (ST-3) and a `substrate` condition arise together, the abort wins: the session MUST enter the abort state rather than `substrate-failure-paused`. An abort is a terminal exercise of a party's right (a party decision); a substrate pause exists only for transient substrate unavailability with no party decision. Both are legal next states from a `*-pending` state per the transition table; this rule resolves which applies when both fire at once.
- (ST-8) **Cross-chain asymmetric open state & resolution.** A cross-chain settle phase MAY reach an *asymmetric open* state in which one leg has irreversibly moved value but the counterpart leg has not yet completed — specifically the HTLC-9 `dest-revealed-source-unclaimed` case (§9.5.4): the payer has claimed the destination (the preimage is public) but the payee's source-side `htlc-claim` has not yet landed. This is **not** a terminal failure: the payee retains a guaranteed window to claim the source (HTLC-7). On detecting it, the settle phase anchors the interim asymmetric SettlementEvidence (`outcome: "failure"`, `reason: dest-revealed-source-unclaimed`, per HTLC-9) and the orchestrator transitions `settle-pending → settle-asymmetric` (non-terminal) rather than to `settle-failed`. The orchestrator MUST watch for the payee's source claim until the source-leg timelock expiry (`expiry_source`, HTLC-7/HTLC-8). **Resolution:** (a) if the `htlc-claim` lands within the window, the phase anchors a superseding `outcome: "success"` SettlementEvidence carrying `settlementFinality` and the full txRef set (`htlc-lock` + `htlc-reveal` + `htlc-claim`) at the canonical evidence address with a `:resolved` suffix, referencing the interim record; the session transitions `settle-asymmetric → settle-completed` and proceeds normally (ST-4), producing a terminal `completed` bundle whose settlement evidence ref is the resolved success record; (b) if `expiry_source` passes with no source claim, the interim failure record stands, the session transitions `settle-asymmetric → settle-failed` (terminal), and the bundle records `failed-counterparty` (the genuine unresolved asymmetric loss, which DACS-X dispute may later address). Because resolution flows through the normal terminal states, DACS-5 derivation reads the terminal bundle `outcome` directly — no amendment scan is required, and no `correction` amendment is used for the success path (the ST-8 forward resolution replaces the former amendment-based closure). The asymmetric-recovery window MUST be bounded by `expiry_source`; an implementation MAY finalise to `settle-failed` earlier only if the source lock can no longer be claimed.

**State → bundle `outcome` mapping (normative).** Every terminal state maps to exactly one AttestationBundle `outcome` (§10.4), partitioned by the terminal phase’s `errorClass` where applicable:

| Terminal state | errorClass | Bundle `outcome` |
|----------------|-----------|------------------|
| `finalised` | — | `completed` |
| `vet-failed` / `negotiate-failed` / `commit-failed` / `settle-failed` | `permanent` | `failed-perm` |
| (same) | `counterparty` | `failed-counterparty` |
| (same) | `transient` (retry budget exhausted) | `failed-perm` |
| (same) | `settlement-atomicity` | `failed-counterparty` |
| (same) | `substrate` | resolves via ST-7 to `failed-substrate`, never a `*-failed` terminal |
| `failed-substrate` | `substrate` | `failed-substrate` |
| `aborted-by-self` | — | `aborted-by-self` |
| `aborted-by-other` | — | `aborted-by-other` |

`transient` after retry-budget exhaustion is a permanent inability to complete the phase → `failed-perm`. `settlement-atomicity` (one side of a cross-chain settlement landed, the other did not) is attributed to the counterparty/rail, not the local party → `failed-counterparty`. A `settle-failed` with `settlement-atomicity` is reached only **after** the asymmetric open state (ST-8) has been entered and its recovery window has expired without resolution; while the window is open the session is in the non-terminal `settle-asymmetric` state, and an `htlc-claim` landing within the window resolves it forward to `settle-completed → finalised` (terminal `completed`) per ST-8 — so a late-settling-but-successful cross-chain swap is recorded as `completed`, not as a failure. No terminal state lacks an `outcome`, and no `outcome` lacks a producing terminal state; `settle-asymmetric` is non-terminal and therefore produces no bundle until it resolves.

#### 10.3.2 Persistence and visibility

SessionRecord is off-chain by default. The orchestrator persists it locally. Counterparties MAY exchange partial views (e.g., the buyer needs to see the seller’s VerifyResultRef from Vet) but each side maintains its own canonical SessionRecord. On bundle production (end of session), the bundle’s contents are derived from the SessionRecord; the SessionRecord itself is not anchored on chain.

### 10.4 Attestation bundle

The frozen end-of-session artifact. Signed by all parties; anchored via SR-2.

```
type AttestationBundle = {

  bundleVersion: "1"

  jobId: string

  outcome: "completed" | "failed-perm" | "failed-counterparty" | "failed-substrate" | "aborted-by-self" | "aborted-by-other"

  anchoredByRole: "buyer" | "seller" | "orchestrator"   // the role of the party that anchored THIS copy; `outcome` is recorded from this party's perspective (matches the §10.4.2 role-derived anchor address)

  listingRef: { listingId: string; version: number; contentHash: string }

  agreementRef?: AttestationRef               // present iff the session reached commit-completed or later; omitted only when terminated before commit-agreement (see §10.4.3)

  parties: BundleParty[]

  phaseSummary: BundlePhaseEntry[]

  vetRecords: AttestationRef[]                // composite verification records

  settlementEvidence: AttestationRef[]

  amendments?: AttestationRef[]

  ratingRefs?: AttestationRef[]               // when the rate phase ran

  recipeRegistryVersion: number               // DACS-2 registry pinned at session start

  railRegistryVersion: number                 // DACS-4 registry pinned at session start

  finalisedAt: number

  signatures: BundleSignature[]               // both buyer and seller (and orchestrator if separate)

}

type BundleParty = {

  role: "buyer" | "seller" | "orchestrator"

  bundleHash: string

  primaryClaim: ClaimReference

}

type BundlePhaseEntry = {

  index: number

  kind: PhaseType

  outcome: "ok" | "fail"

  errorClass?: "permanent" | "transient" | "counterparty" | "substrate" | "settlement-atomicity"

  txRefs?: ChainTxRef[]

  attestationRef?: AttestationRef

}

type BundleSignature = {

  party: ClaimReference                       // primary claim of the signer

  algorithm: "ed25519" | "ecdsa-secp256k1" | "sr1-aggregate"

  value: string                               // ed25519/ecdsa over the domain-separated payload "dacs-bundle:v1:" || bundleHash, NOT the raw bundle hash (§10.4.1)

}
```

#### 10.4.1 Canonical serialisation, hash, and domain-separated signature

Canonical form is RFC 8785 JCS of the bundle with signatures field omitted. Bundle hash is sha256(canonical_form), hex-encoded. Each BundleSignature.value MUST be computed over a domain-separated payload:
signed_bytes = "dacs-bundle:v1:" || bundleHash.value
The "dacs-bundle:v1:" string prefix prevents cross-protocol signature confusion: an attacker capturing a bundle signature MUST NOT be able to replay it as a listing signature, agreement signature, or any other DACS signature even if the hash bytes collide. Verifiers MUST recompute the canonical form, the bundle hash, the prefixed signed_bytes, and verify each signature against the appropriate party’s primary-claim key. Required signers: buyer + seller. If the orchestrator is a distinct party (not buyer or seller), the orchestrator signature is also REQUIRED. Bundles whose outcome is `completed`, `failed-perm`, `failed-counterparty`, or `failed-substrate` and that are missing any required signature MUST be rejected by consumers. A bundle whose outcome is `aborted-by-self` or `aborted-by-other` MAY carry a single signature; consumers MUST NOT reject it on that basis but MUST classify it per the bundle-suppression rule in §10.11.

#### 10.4.2 Anchoring

The bundle MUST be anchored via SR-2. **Two-sided anchoring scheme.** Each signing party (buyer, seller, and orchestrator if distinct) anchors its own bundle at a party-specific address: stor-{sha256(jobId + "-bundle-" + role)} where role is "buyer", "seller", or "orchestrator". In the happy case both sides’ bundles are canonically equal and consumers can read either; in the divergence case both sides are independently retrievable for dispute purposes (see §10.4.3).
Bundles MUST fit within the substrate’s storage-cap soft limit (128 KB on Demos Storage Programs).
**Extended-pointer pattern for large sessions.** Sessions with extensive evidence (large transcripts, attestation chains, multi-party verifications, e.g. a sealed-envelope auction with 50 bidders’ commits and reveals) MAY exceed the size cap. In that case the bundle at the canonical address contains a pointer record:

```
type BundleExtendedPointer = {

  bundleVersion: "1"

  pointerKind: "extended"

  fullBundleUrl: string

  fullBundleContentHash: string

  segmentRefs?: AttestationRef[]              // optional segmented anchoring

  signature: ComponentSignature

}
```

and the full bundle is hosted externally; fullBundleContentHash binds it. Consumers MUST verify the external bundle’s hash against the on-chain pointer before treating it as authoritative.

#### 10.4.3 Bundle production rules

A bundle MUST be produced when the session reaches a terminal state. The bundle MUST include references to all DACS-2 composite verification records, DACS-3 agreement (if any), DACS-4 settlement evidence (one entry per executed phase), DACS-4 amendments (refunds), DACS-5 ratings (if the rate phase ran). The bundle MUST NOT include references to any record outside the session’s scope.
**For sessions terminating before commit-agreement** (aborted-by-self/other in Vet or Negotiate), the bundle MUST include the available vetRecords and a phaseSummary marking the failed phase; agreementRef is omitted.
**For sessions terminating with failed-substrate**, the bundle’s outcome captures the substrate failure; the failure does not count as either party’s fault in DACS-5 reputation derivation.
Two parties producing independent bundles for the same session MUST converge on identical bundle content (by canonical-form equality) or MUST surface the divergence as a dispute. Each side anchors its own bundle at its own derived address; a consumer looking up "the bundle(s) for session X" MUST query both sides’ expected addresses. The canonical addresses for the two sides are stor-{sha256(jobId + "-bundle-buyer")} and stor-{sha256(jobId + "-bundle-seller")} (or substrate-equivalent two-sided addressing). Consumers MUST: (a) fetch both addresses; (b) if exactly one bundle is present, classify the missing side as aborted-by-self per the bundle-suppression rule in §10.11; (c) if both are present and canonically equal, treat as the unified session bundle; (d) if both are present and canonically diverge, treat the session as disputed — each bundle stands on its own signatures and consumers must decide policy (e.g., trust the buyer’s bundle for buyer-reputation, the seller’s for seller-reputation; or flag for human review). v0.1 does not specify a dispute resolution path; divergence is handled out-of-band. A future minor version (DACS-X, dispute) may specify selective transcript disclosure under signed party agreement or arbitrator order.

### 10.5 Reputation derivation

A deterministic function from a set of attestation bundles to a small set of headline reputation metrics, keyed by primary claim.

```
type ReputationDerivation = {

  derivationVersion: "1"

  partyPrimaryClaim: ClaimReference            // the party being scored

  windowStart: number                          // unix ms

  windowEnd: number                            // unix ms

  bundleCount: number

  metrics: {

    completionRate: number | null              // null when party_fault_denom == 0 (bundleCount == 0, or all reconciled bundles failed-substrate)

    counterpartyDisputeRate: number | null

    averageBuyerRating: number | null

    averageSellerRating: number | null

    observedTransactionalVolume: PriceTerm[]   // sum of agreement.terms.price, by currency

  }

  computedAt: number

  bundleRefs: AttestationRef[]                 // the bundles aggregated

}
```

#### 10.5.1 Derivation algorithm

    agreement := fetch_and_verify_agreement(b.agreementRef)   // DACS-3 AgreementDocument

    volume_terms.append(agreement.terms.price)

  volume := groupSumByCurrency(volume_terms)

  bundleCount := |reconciled|   // one per distinct jobId after two-sided reconciliation, not |scoped|

  return ReputationDerivation with computed metrics
```

**Two-sided reconciliation (normative).** Because two-sided anchoring (§10.4.2) can place two bundles for one jobId in the input — each recording `outcome` from *its anchorer's* perspective — the deriver MUST collapse the input to one authoritative bundle per jobId before partitioning (the `reconciled` step above), and MUST interpret `outcome` relative to the *scored* party, not the anchorer. When the scored party's own anchored copy is present (`b.anchoredByRole` == the scored party's role), `outcome` is read literally: `aborted-by-self` means "this party aborted", `aborted-by-other` means "the counterparty aborted against this party". When only a counterparty-anchored copy exists (e.g. the §10.11 bundle-suppression case, where the withdrawing party did not anchor), `outcome` is read through `perspective_flip` — `aborted-by-self ↔ aborted-by-other` and `failed-perm ↔ failed-counterparty` — so the aborter still takes the hit and the victim does not. Reading raw `outcome` across both copies (the pre-reconciliation behaviour) would double-count an abort against the victim and invert the §10.11 guarantee; the reconciliation closes that. "party_at_fault" is otherwise recorded in the bundle’s phaseSummary errorClass (counterparty implies the other party; permanent on a non-cross-chain rail with no settlement-atomicity flag and a successful pre-pay state generally implies the local party at fault); the classification rules are spelled out in the per-phase errorClass tables in chapters 7 and 9. **failed-substrate sessions** are excluded from the party-fault denominator: party_fault_denom = |outcomes| − |failed_substrate|. This ensures substrate-induced failures do not damage either party’s reputation. Metrics with denominator > 0 produce numeric values; metrics with denominator == 0 (e.g., bundleCount=0, or all sessions failed-substrate) produce null — distinct from zero, signalling "no signal" rather than "zero signal". The averageBuyerRating / averageSellerRating metrics are computed by walking each reconciled bundle’s ratingRefs, fetching the referenced RatingRecord, and verifying its signature against the rater’s primary-claim key (the same key class as a BundleSignature, per §10.4.1). A RatingRecord MUST be discarded — not aggregated — unless it binds to the session being scored: the deriver MUST require r.jobId == b.jobId, r.rater MUST be one of the bundle’s parties[].primaryClaim, and r.rater MUST NOT equal the scored party (no self-rating). Only the remaining records’ values, whose target matches the scored party, are aggregated; the metric is null when no qualifying ratings exist. The observedTransactionalVolume metric is computed analogously: for each reconciled bundle whose agreementRef is present, the deriver MUST resolve the AttestationRef to its AgreementDocument via fetch_and_verify_agreement(agreementRef) — fetching the anchor at agreementRef.anchor.locator, comparing the hashed bytes to agreementRef.contentHash (mismatch MUST cause that bundle to be excluded), and parsing the result as a DACS-3 AgreementDocument per the §7.5.2 attestation resolution algorithm — and then sum agreement.terms.price grouped by currency. agreementRef is an AttestationRef, not an inline AgreementDocument, so the volume step MUST dereference it before reading terms.price.

**Rating de-duplication (normative).** Because the two-sided anchoring scheme (§10.4.2) means both parties' bundles for one jobId may both appear in the input before reconciliation, and `ratingRefs` is an array, a naive walk would count the same rating more than once. The deriver MUST aggregate at most one rating per `(r.rater, r.jobId, r.targetRole)` tuple — last-writer-wins by `ratedAt` on a tie — so a rating contributes once per session-direction, not once per anchored bundle copy or per duplicate ref. (This is a counting rule; RT-1/RT-2 already bound each rating's value range.)

**`completionRate` denominator scope.** `party_fault_denom` excludes only `failed-substrate`; it retains counterparty-fault and abort sessions. This is intentional — `completionRate` measures completed-vs-attempted, not blame — but it leaves a residual griefing surface: a counterparty that repeatedly opens and aborts sessions depresses the target's `completionRate` through `aborted-by-other`. `counterpartyDisputeRate` partially offsets this (it rises in step over the same denominator), and consumers SHOULD read the two metrics together rather than `completionRate` alone. A blame-weighted completion metric is a roadmap candidate.

The windowing predicate above bounds against `b.finalisedAt`, which is a producer-set wall-clock value (§10.4) with no anchoring-time cross-check. Because the bundle is anchored via SR-2, a consensus-attested write time is also available. Consumers performing high-stakes derivation SHOULD bound the window against the bundle’s SR-2 anchor timestamp (the substrate’s consensus-attested write time) rather than, or in addition to, the self-asserted `finalisedAt`, and SHOULD flag a `finalisedAt` that diverges materially from the anchor time. This parallels the chain-timestamp discipline already required for sealed-envelope commits in §8.4.3 (SE-2), where the substrate anchor — not the producer’s clock — decides the timestamp; `finalisedAt` is otherwise advisory and the anchor time is authoritative for windowing.

#### 10.5.2 Per-primary-claim keying

The same wallet may hold multiple primary claims (key:…, did:…, lei:…). DACS-5 reputation is computed *per primary claim*. A great reputation against key:0xabc... does NOT inherit into a brand-new lei:984500ABCDEF… presentation, even though the same wallet may control both. Consumers querying reputation MUST query with the specific primary claim used in the current bundle’s presentedBy, not a wallet identifier or session pubkey. SR-1 (cross-substrate identity aggregation) is the substrate primitive that makes the wallet ↔ multi-primary-claim relationship explicit, allowing consumers to optionally surface "this party also has reputation under primary claim X" — informationally, NOT as inheritance.

#### 10.5.3 Computation surfaces

Derivation MAY be computed: (a) lazily by a querying party (over a set of bundles they fetched themselves — highest trust); (b) by a DACS-5 catalog operator (similar to a DACS-1 catalog — indexed for performance, but consumers MUST verify against the underlying bundles for high-stakes decisions); (c) on chain via an ERC-8004 reputation registry write per §10.7. Each surface is a different point on the trust / performance trade-off; the algorithm is the same.

#### 10.5.4 Category-scoped derivation

The §10.5.1 derivation algorithm is unscoped: it aggregates all bundles for a party within a time window regardless of the service category involved. This is useful for overall reputation but obscures domain-specific track records — a party with excellent DeFi data delivery and a poor regulatory-data track record looks identical to one that is mediocre across the board.

**Category-scoped derivation** restricts the bundle set to sessions whose service category — the `offering.category` of the **listing** the agreement was formed against (the `AgreementDocument` itself carries only `listingRef`, not the category) — matches a given category prefix before applying the §10.5.1 algorithm:

```
derive_category_scoped(party, bundles, windowStart, windowEnd, categoryScope):

  // 1. Filter to bundles whose agreement's category is within categoryScope
  category_bundles := [b for b in bundles
                        where b.agreementRef is present
                        AND fetch_category(b.agreementRef) starts_with categoryScope]

  // 2. Apply the standard §10.5.1 derive() algorithm over category_bundles
  return derive(party, category_bundles, windowStart, windowEnd)
```

`fetch_category` performs the full two-step resolution: (1) resolve the bundle's `agreementRef` to its `AgreementDocument` (per the §7.5.2 attestation resolution algorithm); (2) resolve that document's `listingRef` to the Listing, verifying the fetched bytes against `listingRef.contentHash`; then return the Listing's `offering.category`. Bundles whose `agreementRef` **or** `listingRef` cannot be resolved (or whose listing content-hash does not match) MUST be excluded from the category-scoped set (not treated as matching any category).

**`categoryScope` matching rule.** Let `cat = fetch_category(b.agreementRef)` (the resolved listing's `offering.category`). A bundle's category matches `categoryScope` if and only if `cat == categoryScope` OR `cat` starts with `categoryScope + "."`. Examples: scope `"data.finance"` matches `"data.finance"`, `"data.finance.fx"`, `"data.finance.equities"` but NOT `"data.financetools"`.

**Use in `ReputationHint` (§6.3.6).** The `ReputationHint` attached to a `ListingSummary` is computed by applying `derive_category_scoped` with `categoryScope` equal to the listing's `offering.category` (or a prefix thereof — catalogs MAY broaden the scope when the listing category has fewer than a minimum number of qualifying bundles, provided the `reputationHint.categoryScope` field accurately reflects which scope was used). Consumers MUST read `reputationHint.categoryScope` to understand what population is reflected; the hint is only a fast-path pre-filter and MUST be verified against underlying bundles for high-stakes decisions.

**Relationship to §10.5.2 per-primary-claim keying.** Category scoping is an orthogonal filter applied after the per-primary-claim scope; it does not change the identity keying rule.

### 10.6 The rate phase (optional)

A DACS-5 phase that produces structured ratings between parties at session end.

```
type RatingRecord = {

  ratingVersion: "1"

  jobId: string

  rater: ClaimReference                        // primary claim of the rating party

  target: ClaimReference                       // primary claim of the rated party

  targetRole: "buyer" | "seller"

  value: number                                // 1..5 inclusive integer

  freeText?: string                            // optional; max 1000 chars

  dimensions?: Record<string, number>          // optional per-dimension scores (timeliness, communication, etc.)

  ratedAt: number

  signature: ComponentSignature

}
```

#### 10.6.1 Phase contract

rate is OPTIONAL in a pipeline. When present, the phase MUST: run after all settle-* phases complete with ok: true; produce one RatingRecord per direction (buyer→seller, seller→buyer); sign each RatingRecord over the domain-separated payload "dacs-rating:v1:" || sha256(canonical_JCS(record_without_signature)) per chapter 7§7.7; anchor each RatingRecord via SR-2 at dacs5:rating:{jobId}:{rater} (where {rater} is the RatingRecord.rater ClaimReference rendered per the §6.3.4 logical-address escaping rule for colon-containing claim references); include both ratingRefs in the bundle. Sellers and buyers MAY decline to rate; absence of a rating does not block bundle production. The pipeline step parameters MAY specify { required: true | false } per side.

**Rating bounds & dimensions (rules RT-1, RT-2).** (RT-1) A rate-phase producer MUST reject — and MUST NOT anchor — a RatingRecord whose `value` is not an integer in the inclusive range [1,5], or whose `freeText` exceeds 1000 characters. (RT-2) A reputation deriver MUST exclude (not clamp) any RatingRecord failing RT-1 from aggregation, so a malformed or hostile self-signed rating cannot enter `averageBuyerRating` / `averageSellerRating` even if a producer skips RT-1. The optional `dimensions` field is **opaque pass-through metadata**: DACS-5 reputation derivation does not interpret or aggregate it, it carries no protocol semantics, its keys and value ranges are unconstrained, and consumers MUST NOT rely on it for any conformance-bearing decision. (A canonical dimension namespace with per-dimension reputation is a roadmap candidate.)

### 10.7 ERC-8004 publication surface

DACS-5 bundles can OPTIONALLY be reflected to the Ethereum ERC-8004 reputation / validation registries for EVM-side consumers.

#### 10.7.1 Mapping

When a party holds an erc8004 claim in their bundle, the publisher MAY write a reputation/validation registry entry referencing the bundle anchor. The publisher MUST: include in the registry entry the bundleAnchorLocator and bundleContentHash; sign the registry write with the key that owns the ERC-8004 token; rate-limit registry writes to avoid spam (suggested: at most one write per session per direction).

#### 10.7.2 Consumption

EVM-side consumers MAY read ERC-8004 entries as a discovery surface for DACS-5 bundles. They MUST fetch the referenced bundle and validate it independently. The ERC-8004 entry is a pointer, not a substitute for the bundle.
**Substrate decoupling.** Publication to ERC-8004 is OPTIONAL and is a Demos-to-Ethereum cross-pollination convenience. Other substrates MAY define equivalent publication surfaces (e.g., a Solana reputation program, a Bitcoin OP_RETURN scheme). DACS-5 does not require any particular publication surface; the bundle is the canonical artifact.

### 10.8 Conformance summary

| Role | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Orchestrator | Maintain SessionRecord per §10.3; transition states deterministically; produce bundle on terminal state |
| Bundle producer | Sign per §10.4.1; anchor per §10.4.2; include all required references per §10.4.3 |
| Bundle consumer | Recompute canonical hash; verify domain-separated signatures; dereference and validate every contained AttestationRef |
| Reputation deriver | Apply algorithm in §10.5.1 verbatim; partition by primary claim; treat failed-substrate per the denominator rule; return null for zero-denominator metrics |
| Rate phase handler | One RatingRecord per direction; reject out-of-range `value` (non-integer or ∉[1,5]) / over-length `freeText` before anchoring (RT-1); anchor each; include in bundle |
| ERC-8004 publisher (optional) | §10.7.1 mapping; rate-limit writes; sign with token-owner key |

### 10.9 Rationale

**Session record off-chain by default vs anchored.** Anchoring the live session record every state transition would dominate session economics for no audit benefit (the bundle captures what auditors need; the intermediate state is operational noise). Off-chain SessionRecord, on-chain bundle, is the right split.
**Bundle as the unit of audit vs individual phase records.** Each phase already anchors its evidence; the bundle is the unifying envelope. Auditors verifying a session need ONE artifact to start from; from there they walk the references. Without a bundle, every consumer would have to reconstruct the session graph from disparate anchors.
**Domain-separated bundle signature.** A bundle signature must not be confused with a listing signature, agreement signature, or any other DACS signature even when hash bytes collide. The "dacs-bundle:v1:" prefix prevents cross-protocol replay at zero cost. The bundle separator is part of the universal DACS signature scheme defined in chapter 7§7.7; every DACS v0.1 artifact uses its own separator from the same registry.
**Per-primary-claim reputation vs wallet-keyed.** Wallet-keyed reputation lets a great key:0xabc... reputation laundered into a brand-new lei:… presentation. Per-primary-claim keying prevents this. The same wallet honestly holding multiple claims accumulates separate reputations per tier; consumers can surface the cross-claim relationship (via SR-1) informationally without inheritance.
**Substrate-failure exclusion from party-fault denominators.** If a session fails because the substrate was down, neither party did anything wrong; counting it as either party’s fault would create incentives for parties to avoid sessions during substrate strain. Excluding failed-substrate from the denominator keeps the metric honest.
**Null metrics vs zero metrics.** A new party with bundleCount=0 has no signal, not a zero signal. Zero would imply "completed 0% of sessions" — misleading. Null forces consumers to handle "no data" deliberately rather than treating new parties as worst-rated.
**Optional rate phase vs required.** Forcing every session to produce ratings would create rating noise (parties post 5-stars to avoid friction) and would expose parties to rating retaliation. Optional rating, with both sides able to decline, matches institutional practice and platform-marketplace norms.
**ERC-8004 as optional publication vs required.** ERC-8004 is the dominant EVM reputation registry, but DACS-5 ships on substrates without an Ethereum-mainnet write path. Optional publication is the right scope.
**Extended-pointer pattern for oversized bundles.** Real sessions occasionally produce bundles larger than the substrate’s storage-program cap (multi-party auctions, sessions with large attestation chains). Hard-failing such sessions would force a different audit format; the extended-pointer pattern keeps the canonical artifact at the on-chain address and ferries the rest off-chain with content-hash binding.

### 10.10 Backwards compatibility

**ERC-8004 reputation / validation registries.** §10.7 specifies the publication surface. DACS-5 inherits ERC-8004’s read semantics for EVM consumers; ERC-8004 itself is unchanged.
**Existing operator-marketplace ratings.** A marketplace migrating to DACS-5 can import its historical rating data as a one-time backfill of RatingRecord-equivalent entries signed by the marketplace operator. New ratings produced under DACS-5 stand alone; historical ratings stand under the marketplace’s signature and are clearly distinguishable.
**Audit-log standards.** A consumer that wants to feed a DACS-5 bundle into an existing audit-log pipeline (RFC 5424, OpenTelemetry) can convert the bundle to those formats at read time. DACS-5 itself defines only the bundle.
**Future DACS-X (dispute).** A future standard covering dispute resolution is anticipated. It will compose with DACS-5 by referencing bundles and producing dispute records; v0.1 of DACS-5 is forward-compatible with this addition (the bundle’s phaseSummary and outcome fields are sufficient for dispute proceedings to consume).

### 10.11 Security considerations

**Bundle forgery.** *Threat:* an attacker produces a fake bundle claiming a session that did not happen, hoping to influence reputation. *Mitigation:* the bundle must be co-signed by both parties; signatures use domain-separated payloads; consumers verify both signatures against the parties’ verified primary claims. A unilateral bundle cannot influence the counterparty’s reputation.
**Bundle suppression.** *Threat:* a party who performed badly in a session refuses to sign the bundle, hoping to prevent its publication. *Mitigation:* the non-signing party’s outcome (aborted-by-self) is recorded in the counterparty’s bundle attempt; consumers seeing a bundle with only one signature MUST classify the session as aborted-by-self for the non-signer and aborted-by-other for the signer. The non-signer’s reputation takes the appropriate hit even if they refuse to sign. (Implementation note: a one-sided bundle MUST follow exactly the same canonical form and signing rules; the absence of the counterparty’s signature is what flags the outcome. This is the carve-out referenced by §10.4.1 — the reject-missing-required-signature rule applies only to the non-abort outcomes, so a one-signature `aborted-by-self`/`aborted-by-other` bundle reaches this classification rather than being rejected.)
**Sybil reputation farming.** *Threat:* an attacker creates many cheap primary claims (key:…) and farms self-deal reputation between them. *Mitigation:* DACS-5 metrics are partitioned by primary claim and do not inherit; Sybil farming over key:… claims accumulates reputation only against those claims, not against higher-tier presentations. The DACS-2 supplementary signals (counterparty being a known Sybil cluster) feed back into Vet for any party who cares.
**Replay across sessions.** *Threat:* an attacker captures a signed bundle and replays it as a different session’s bundle. *Mitigation:* the bundle includes jobId; the signature payload includes the bundle hash which includes jobId. Replay against a different jobId fails verification.
**Cross-protocol signature confusion.** *Threat:* a bundle signature is replayed as some other DACS signature (listing, agreement) where the underlying hash bytes happen to align. *Mitigation:* the universal signature scheme in chapter 7§7.7 defines per-artifact domain separators across the entire DACS v0.1 stack; the bundle domain separator is "dacs-bundle:v1:" and other artifact kinds use their own separators per the table in §7.7. A signature produced under any artifact kind cannot validate as a signature under any other kind, even when the hash bytes coincide.
**Reputation poisoning via collusion.** *Threat:* two colluding parties run many fake sessions to inflate each other’s reputation. *Mitigation:* this is fundamentally hard to prevent at the protocol level. DACS-5 mitigates by per-primary-claim keying (collusion inflates only one tier of reputation), by transactional-volume reporting (consumers can see if a party’s reputation comes from many tiny sessions vs few large ones), and by composability with external signal sources. The volume signal is **weak and must not be over-trusted**: `observedTransactionalVolume` is reported per-currency, unnormalised, with no FX conversion and no per-row transaction count (§10.5), so a colluding pair transacting across many low-significance currencies can keep every `PriceTerm` row small and evade the "few large vs many tiny" heuristic; cross-currency rows are not comparable or summable. Consumers SHOULD read volume alongside `bundleCount` and external signals rather than as a standalone collusion gate. (A per-row transaction count and an FX-normalised aggregate would strengthen it — roadmap.) Consumers handling stakes worth the cost of collusion SHOULD weigh DACS-5 metrics against external signals.
**Orchestrator misclassification of errorClass.** *Threat:* the orchestrator classifies a counterparty failure as a substrate failure (or vice versa) to bias reputation. *Mitigation:* the bundle phaseSummary carries the errorClass; both parties sign the bundle; a party that disagrees with the classification refuses to sign, producing aborted-by-other. The honest party’s independent bundle (with their own classification) is the source of truth for their reputation. Persistent classification disputes are a DACS-X concern.
**Bundle anchor unavailability.** *Threat:* the SR-2 anchor becomes unreadable after the session ends (e.g. storage program purged, IPFS unpinned). *Mitigation:* on-substrate anchoring (Demos Storage Programs) provides indefinite availability under substrate operation. Off-substrate anchoring (IPFS, HTTPS) is best-effort. Listings concerned with long-term auditability SHOULD use on-substrate anchoring for bundles regardless of which surface the rest of the session uses.
**Time-bound reputation windows.** *Threat:* an old, no-longer-representative reputation is presented as current; or a producer backdates or forward-dates the self-asserted `finalisedAt` to move a session out of a scrutinised window or to cluster volume into a favourable one. *Mitigation:* derivations are window-bounded; consumers querying reputation MUST specify a window and SHOULD weight recent windows more heavily. The algorithm does not specify weighting (consumers choose); it does require explicit window bounds in every derivation. Against producer-chosen `finalisedAt`, consumers performing high-stakes derivation SHOULD window against the SR-2 anchor timestamp per §10.5.1, so that the substrate — not the bundle producer — decides window membership.
**ERC-8004 write spamming.** *Threat:* an attacker writes many fake ERC-8004 entries pointing at fabricated bundles. *Mitigation:* ERC-8004 entries are pointers; consumers MUST fetch and validate the bundle. Fake bundles fail at validation. The cost of writing many ERC-8004 entries (gas) is a natural rate limit; DACS-5 publishers SHOULD additionally enforce per-session rate limits.

## Chapter 11 — Stewardship, versioning, follow-on

### 11.1 Stewardship and versioning

#### 11.1.1 Current steward

DACS v0.1 is stewarded by **KyneSys Labs**. This means: the registry signing key currently used to sign recipes (DACS-2) and rail definitions (DACS-4) is held by KyneSys Labs; the canonical anchored addresses for those registries are written by KyneSys Labs; spec changes between minor versions are reviewed and merged by KyneSys Labs. This is a single-steward arrangement — phase PA-2 in the progressive-anchoring scheme defined in §7.4.4. It is **not** the long-term governance target; it is the honest description of where v0.1 sits at time of publication.
Multi-party governance — a constituted working group, formal multi-signature schemes for the registries, sub-authority delegation by domain (sanctions lists, financial regulation, settlement rails) — is open work. v0.1 ships under single-steward semantics so the standard can move forward; transitioning to a multi-party arrangement is anticipated as the ecosystem of implementers, reviewers, and operators grows. The PA-2 → PA-3 transition (§7.4.4) is the formal anchor point for that change.
**(GOV-1)** Implementations consuming the registries MUST disclose to their users which signing key they treat as authoritative and MUST NOT misrepresent the current steward as a constituted multi-party body. Third-party implementations (such as PATH-OS Labs’ reference) MAY operate against the same canonical registries; the steward arrangement governs who writes the registries, not who reads them.

#### 11.1.2 Versioning

DACS v0.1 is a common baseline: all five per-stage standards, the front-matter substrate-binding, the threat model, the glossary, and the conformance plan are published together at v0.1, the first publicly released version. From this baseline onward each per-stage standard versions independently — a standard that gains capabilities bumps its own version without forcing the others, and a pipeline composes a coherent set of per-stage versions. Within a standard, major versions (v1, v2, …) break compatibility; minor versions (v0.2, v0.3, …) add capabilities while preserving forward-readable shapes. v0.1 freezes the registries (claim schemes in DACS-1, methods/recipes in DACS-2, patterns in DACS-3, rails in DACS-4) as an immutable baseline; later additions happen via minor-version registry updates released by the current steward, **appended to the same registry-index document** (`dacs2:registry:v0.1` / `dacs4:registry:v0.1`). That index address is the registry's **major-version line**: the `:v0.1` suffix denotes the v0.x line, not a content snapshot — the index document grows additively across minor versions and is re-addressed only on a major (v1 → v2) bump. A consumer therefore always resolves the same address and sees every v0.x entry; "frozen at v0.1" means the original baseline entries are immutable (never mutated in place), not that the index stops growing. Each entry carries its own `recipeVersion` / `railVersion` for per-session pinning (§7.4.3 / §9.4.3). v1.0 is the version at which a standard is considered ready for unsupervised production use.

#### 11.1.3 Conformance philosophy

Each spec’s conformance section enumerates the requirements an implementation must satisfy to claim conformance to that spec. Cross-spec conformance (a full DACS-1…DACS-5 implementation) is the conjunction of per-spec conformance for every spec the implementation covers. Implementations MAY cover a strict subset (e.g., DACS-1 + DACS-4 only, for a payment-rail aggregator that does not negotiate or rate); conformance is then to the implemented subset.

#### 11.1.4 Substrate stance

DACS does not standardise the substrate. The substrate-capability statements (SR-1 through SR-5) are the abstract contract. Any substrate that provides them can host a compatible implementation. Demos is the substrate against which DACS was designed and ships all five capabilities natively; other substrates (Ethereum L1+L2 stack with bridges, Polkadot, Cosmos with privacy zones) MAY satisfy varying subsets and host correspondingly varying DACS subsets. SR-1, SR-2, and SR-5 are protocol-specified; SR-3 and SR-4 are trust-property specified in v0.1, with wire-protocol harmonisation expected in v2.

#### 11.1.5 Composition stance

DACS composes with the existing open ecosystem and does not seek to replace standards that already work. Where existing standards have gaps relevant to agent commerce (negotiation patterns, end-to-end audit), DACS specifies new standards as narrowly as possible, with explicit substrate dependencies. The composed-standards table in chapter 8 (front matter) is the comprehensive list of touchpoints; when an underlying standard updates, the corresponding DACS standard’s registry entry updates in the next minor version.

### 11.2 Follow-on topics

Seven areas are deliberately out of scope for v0.1 and intended for subsequent standards.

#### 11.2.1 Dispute resolution (DACS-X, anticipated)

v0.1 produces signed, anchored bundles. v0.1 does not specify what happens when parties disagree about a bundle’s contents, contest a settlement amendment, or wish to invoke an arbitrator. A follow-on standard (working name DACS-X) is anticipated to: specify a dispute initiation phase referencing one or more bundles; specify selective transcript disclosure protocols (revealing channel transcripts to a named arbitrator under signed party agreement); specify arbitrator credentialing patterns (likely composing DACS-1 + DACS-2 — arbitrators are agents with verified credentials); specify dispute outcome bundles that supersede or annotate the original session bundles.

#### 11.2.2 Open phase set

v0.1’s phase types are closed across DACS-2/3/4/5. v2 may relax this to permit ecosystem-defined phases under the steward’s oversight. Until then, x- experimental phases provide an escape valve for out-of-band agreement.

#### 11.2.3 Multi-party transactions beyond bilateral

v0.1 negotiation is bilateral (except sealed-envelope, which is one seller / many bidders). True multi-party transactions — syndicated trades, multi-seller bundles, escrow-with-arbitrator three-party flows — are out of scope. DACS-3 v0.2 will likely add a negotiate-multi-quote pattern; truly multi-party flows are likely v2 territory.

#### 11.2.4 Streaming / continuous-flow rails

v0.1 rails are discrete-transaction. Streaming payment rails (Sablier-style, payment per second of usage) and continuous-delivery rails (per-second compute, per-byte data feed) are out of scope. A future DACS-4 v0.2 entry (rail type continuous) is anticipated.

#### 11.2.5 Cross-DACS-version compatibility

Each per-stage standard specifies forward-compatibility within itself (a later-minor reader handles earlier-minor bundles of the same standard). Cross-version compatibility (a DACS-1 v2 listing pipelined against a DACS-3 v0.1 negotiator) is deferred; pipelines MUST currently use a coherent set of per-stage versions.

**v0.1 version-signalling scope.** Every anchored artifact carries a `*Version` literal (`dacsVersion`, `bundleVersion`, `agreementVersion`, `evidenceVersion`, `ratingVersion`, `resultVersion`) that records the **major** version only; in v0.1 these are all `"1"`. The listing-validation "dacsVersion supported" gate (§6.3.4 step 2) is therefore a **major-version** check in v0.1 — meaningful against a future major (v2) break, but not minor-discriminating. Two things are consequently **not** signalled in v0.1 and are roadmapped: (a) a per-artifact **producing-minor-version** field, which a reader would need to select an era-specific decode path (the later-reads-earlier direction is already handled for signed artifacts by SIG-5 preserve-unknown + "forward-readable shapes"); and (b) the **older-reader-newer-minor** direction (an older reader encountering a higher-minor artifact) — undefined in v0.1. Since v0.1 is the single published baseline, neither bites today; both land with the cross-version compatibility work above.

#### 11.2.6 Multi-party governance and registry stewardship

The transition from single-steward (PA-2) to multi-party constituted governance (PA-3) for the recipe and rail registries is itself follow-on work. v0.1 does not specify the constitution mechanism, multi-signature thresholds, sub-authority delegation, or transition procedure. These are open questions for the working group that the ecosystem chooses to constitute. Until that body exists, the current steward operates under the disclosure rules in §11.1.1.

#### 11.2.7 Selective-disclosure / minimised-claim presentation

v0.1 discloses a presented bundle's full `claims[]` set and its `presentedBy` primary claim to every counterparty (§6.3.2 scope note). The DACS-2 zkTLS / TLSNotary methods hide the secret inside a claim's verification but not which claims a party holds. A follow-on standard is anticipated to add bundle-layer selective disclosure — per-claim blinding, commitments with selective open, proof-of-possession-without-disclosure, and an unlinkable or rotating primary-claim presentation that preserves reputation continuity without exposing the durable high-tier identity in low-stakes interactions. Until then, the only minimisation is presenter-side bundle pruning, with the linkability caveat in §6.3.2.

### 11.3 Closing

Agent commerce is moving from prototype to production. DACS is a contribution toward keeping the lifecycle on public infrastructure: a stack that composes with the existing open standards where they work, fills the gaps where they don’t, and makes substrate dependencies explicit. A reference implementation runs the lifecycle end-to-end on the Demos substrate; an independent third-party reference implementation (PATH-OS Labs’ pathos-dacs-ref) implements the DACS-1 + DACS-2-GLEIF + DACS-5 verifier subset against the same spec.
What this document is **not**: a finished standard ready for unsupervised production at every scale. The honest list of remaining work — beyond the per-stage follow-on topics in §11.2 — includes: protocol-level wire specifications for SR-3 and SR-4 (currently trust-property specified only); expansion of independent reference-implementation coverage beyond the current third-party verifier; engagement with the maintainers of every composed standard (ERC-8004, AP2 via FIDO Alliance, W3C VC, A2A) to convert "DACS composes with X" from a unilateral claim into a documented cross-maintainer conversation; a unified threat-model audit (§12) reviewed by parties outside the current stewardship; constitution of multi-party governance (§11.2.6); and conformance test suites (§14) ready for implementers to run against.
Some of these will reveal gaps that need new work, not just refinement. The intent of v0.1 is to ship a coherent baseline that the next 6–12 months of implementation experience and ecosystem engagement can sharpen. It is not the final word on agent commerce.

## Chapter 12 — Unified threat model

This chapter collects, partitions, and rationalises the per-chapter security considerations into a unified threat model. It is the artifact a security review would start from. Where this chapter restates per-chapter threats, the per-chapter mitigation is normative; this chapter’s framing is informative.

### 12.1 Scope and non-goals

DACS’s security goals are: (a) cryptographic non-repudiation of every per-session artifact (listings, bundles, agreements, evidence) by the parties that produced them; (b) tamper-evident audit trail — any modification of an anchored artifact is detectable by content-hash comparison; (c) limited-trust substrate dependency — the substrate is trusted for liveness and consensus per its own security model, not for application-layer semantics; (d) prevention of cross-protocol signature confusion via the universal domain-separation scheme in §7.7; (e) prevention of replay across sessions via per-session jobIds, nonces, and content hashes; (f) substrate-failure isolation in reputation derivation so substrate outages do not damage party reputations.
Non-goals: DACS does **not** prevent collusion between buyer and seller (two parties who jointly fabricate a session produce a valid session; the audit trail records what they say happened, not what objectively happened). DACS does **not** prevent denial-of-service by a counterparty or by the substrate (it produces evidence of the failure for reputation purposes, but does not guarantee progress). DACS does **not** prevent regulatory non-compliance — it produces artifacts useful for compliance audit but does not enforce any specific regulatory regime. DACS does **not** provide unconditional privacy — the SR-4 channel contents stay between members, but member identity and timing of commitments are visible on the public chain by design. **This visibility extends to the audit layer**: anchored DACS-5 bundles, commit-agreement records, and DACS-2 vet attestations carry party **primary claims — durable authority-issued identities (LEI, FINRA-CRD, …) — in cleartext at derivable addresses**, so a passive observer can reconstruct the **counterparty graph** (who transacted with whom, correlatable across every session an identity runs) with **no cryptography to break**, and can read each vet attestation's `scheme:identifier:decision` (e.g. "party X was screened against OFAC → clear"). DACS accepts this by design — it is an *accountability* standard, and a public, verifiable audit trail necessarily exposes the relationship. (Raw private *values* behind a verification are separately protected by the §7.5 public-anchor data-minimisation rule; only predicate outcomes are exposed.) A confidentiality layer that anchors these records **encrypted to the parties** while keeping the content hash public for tamper-evidence is roadmap work, not v0.1.

### 12.2 Adversary model

The threat model assumes adversaries with the following capabilities; per-threat mitigations specify which class is being defended against.

| Adversary class | Capabilities | Assumed not capable of |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Network observer | Reads all public-chain traffic; can perform timing analysis on commitments; **can reconstruct the counterparty graph from anchored bundles / commit-agreement records / vet attestations (cleartext primary claims at derivable addresses) and read each vet attestation's scheme:identifier:decision**; cannot read private-channel contents. | Breaking standard cryptographic primitives (sha256, Ed25519, ECDSA-secp256k1 under standard assumptions); recovering the raw private values behind a verification (predicate-outcome-only under §7.5 minimisation). |
| Network active attacker | Can drop, delay, reorder, or inject messages on transport links; can MITM TLS sessions if PKI is compromised. | Forging signatures by valid private keys; producing sha256 preimages. |
| Malicious counterparty | Operates a fully-conformant DACS implementation but maximises self-interest within the protocol; signs everything they’re willing to be held to and refuses to sign anything else. | Forging the other party’s signatures; controlling validator-set consensus on the substrate. |
| Compromised authority | A registry authority (GLEIF, FINRA, OFAC, etc.) returns false data, either by deliberate compromise or by API corruption. | Forging substrate-validator signatures over the false response (validators sign the fetch result, not the data’s factuality). |
| Substrate validator-set minority | A minority of substrate validators is compromised; the consensus protocol’s normal Byzantine bound holds. | Producing valid consensus signatures on falsehoods (assuming the BFT assumption holds). |
| Substrate validator-set majority | A majority of substrate validators is compromised. | (none — above the substrate’s security floor; DACS inherits the failure.) |
| Substrate operator (rotating shard) | For Liquidity Tank-style SR-5: the rotating validator shard operating tanks is partially compromised within its multisig threshold. | Bypassing the 2/3 BFT multisig or the deployer emergency-recovery path. |
| Channel operator (SR-4) | Operates the private negotiation channel; can drop messages, fork views, observe all member messages. | Forging member signatures inside the channel; observing messages encrypted to a member subset (with realisation-appropriate encryption). |
| Recipe-registry attacker | Compromises the recipe registry signing key, attempts to push poisoned recipes. | Backdating recipe-version pinning; affecting already-pinned sessions. |
| Sybil attacker | Generates unlimited low-tier (key:…) identities and farms self-deal reputation. | Generating authority-issued claims (lei, finra-crd, etc.) without owning the underlying registrations. |
| Malicious orchestrator | Drives the session pipeline, assigns `errorClass`, constructs the SessionRecord, and MAY be a distinct REQUIRED signer (§10.4.1); can misclassify failures, drop or reorder phase results, or selectively anchor. | Forging buyer/seller signatures, or producing a both-sided-signed bundle without honest-party consent (§10.11 two-sided independent bundles; party-disagreement → aborted-by-other). |
| Malicious infrastructure | Operates discovery/index/storage infrastructure a party depends on (catalog API, listings index, anchor host); can serve poisoned, stale, or withheld data on the read path. | Forging the signatures on the signed artifacts it serves (consumers dereference anchors and verify content hashes + signatures independently). |
| Malicious verifier | Runs the DACS-2 vet path; can mis-run a recipe, substitute a method, or assert a decision the authority did not return. | Forging the authority's signed/consensus-anchored response, or a recipe steward signature; producing a VerifyResult that re-derives correctly under method/recipe-version checks. |
| Spam / resource-exhaustion adversary | Floods a public surface (ERC-8004 registry writes, negotiation-channel griefing, mempool) to raise cost or degrade availability. | Forging identities or claims (each write/identity costs); breaking liveness of correctly-rate-limited or staked surfaces. |

**Reconciling the §12.4 "Primary adversary" column with this model.** Every §12.4 row's adversary resolves to a class above, with two conventions: (a) **variants of an existing class** — "competing bidder" and "two colluding counterparties" are *Malicious counterparty* (single and colluding); "public-mempool observer" is *Network observer*; "storage operator" is *Malicious infrastructure*. (b) **Non-adversary conditions** — "time" (TOCTOU / stale-window races) and "implementation bug" (e.g. decimal overflow) are **environmental / robustness** conditions, not adversaries: the threat is real and the cited mitigation stands, but there is no actor to model — these rows are defended by deterministic rules and bounds, not by an adversary assumption.

### 12.3 Trust boundaries

A reader following the audit trail from a DACS-5 bundle backwards through the lifecycle crosses these trust boundaries; each boundary has its own assumptions.

- **Party-to-party cryptographic boundary.** Every signed artifact (listing, bundle, agreement, evidence, rating) is verifiable against the signer’s primary-claim key. Trust assumption: the signing key has not been compromised at or before the artifact’s timestamp. Mitigation: key-rotation handling per §6.6 (DACS-1 security considerations).
- **Party-to-authority boundary.** A DACS-2 VerifyResult of method consensus-backed-proxy depends on the authority (GLEIF, FINRA, OFAC, etc.) being honest at fetch time and on the TLS PKI between the substrate validators and the authority. Mitigation: the recipe’s alternatives mechanism (§7.4) lets high-stakes schemes declare additional independent verification methods (§7.12); the v0.2 strengthening (§7.3.5) will tighten the consensus-backed-proxy method itself.
- **Party-to-substrate boundary.** Every anchor (listings, bundles, evidence, recipes, rails) depends on the substrate’s SR-2 implementation for availability and content integrity. Trust assumption: substrate validator-set is honest per the substrate’s consensus protocol. Mitigation: on-substrate anchoring (Storage Programs on Demos) provides indefinite availability; off-substrate anchoring (IPFS, HTTPS) is best-effort.
- **Substrate-to-substrate boundary (cross-chain).** SR-5 atomic settlement crosses chains and depends on the SR-5 mechanism’s trust model (HTLC: cryptographic only; Liquidity Tank: substrate operator; substrate-native: substrate consensus). Mitigation: explicit rail-trust-model disclosure in rail definitions; per-stake rail selection.
- **Party-to-recipe-registry boundary.** Verification routes through recipes whose signing authority is the registry steward (currently KyneSys Labs, per §7.4.4 and §11.1.1). Trust assumption: the steward’s signing key is honest and uncompromised. Mitigation: monotonic recipe-version pinning per session; emergency-revision discipline (§7.4.4). Residual risk under PA-2: steward-key compromise; PA-3 multi-signature governance is the v0.2+ mitigation pathway.

### 12.5 Composite trust property

A DACS-5 bundle that validates against all per-chapter conformance rules and whose contained references all dereference and validate provides the following composite trust property to a consumer: "Two or more parties identified by the named primary claims (with the trust profile each claim’s scheme implies) participated in a session against the named listing version, agreed to the named terms, exchanged the named settlements, and produced this audit record. The substrate operator did not collude with the parties to forge the record. The recipe registry was not compromised at the time of the verifications. The composed external standards (W3C VC, TLSNotary, ACME, etc.) behaved per their own security models." This is the composite security claim of DACS v0.1. Each clause has explicit mitigation in the per-chapter sections; each has explicit residual risk in this chapter’s adversary model.

## Chapter 14 — Conformance test plan

This chapter sketches the test categories an implementer should cover to claim conformance to each DACS standard. It is a **plan, not a test suite**; the test suite itself (test vectors, expected outputs, golden files) is produced separately and tracked alongside reference implementations. Where a chapter’s conformance summary enumerates labelled rules (e.g., BP-1, LR-2, CM-3), the test plan groups them into runnable categories.

### 14.1 DACS-1 — Identify

- **Claim reference parser.** Test vectors for every v0.1 scheme: valid canonical form, valid non-canonical form (must canonicalise on read), invalid grammar (must reject), unknown-scheme handling (must not silently accept).
- **Bundle producer (BP-1..BP-4).** Round-trip: produce bundle → canonical form → hash → sign-with-domain-separator → anchor. Verify each output against fixture.
- **Bundle reader (BR-1..BR-5).** Accept-conformant-bundle, reject-unsigned-bundle, reject-missing-required-verifiedBy, treat-unknown-scheme-as-unverified, reject-unverified-presentedBy-when-primaryClaimSelector-set.
- **BundleRequirement matching.** All branches of the match algorithm: required-claim missing, required-claim failing-verification, oneOf-group satisfied/unsatisfied, primaryClaimSelector match/mismatch.
- **Listing publisher (LP-1..LP-4).** Sign-with-domain-separator, anchor, version monotonicity, revocation marker publication.
- **Listing reader (LR-1..LR-3).** Validation-order halt-on-first-failure (one test per validation step), revoked-listing refusal, size-cap rejection.
- **Discovery.** well-known parser; catalog endpoint shape; anchor cross-check from ListingSummary.

### 14.2 DACS-2 — Vet

- **Method common contract (CM-1..CM-5).** For each of the eight v0.1 methods: input-shape validation; outcome classification (pass/fail/indeterminate); attestation anchoring; VerifyResult emission with correct method field; canonical form + domain-separated signature.
- **Recipe authoring (RA-1..RA-5).** Steward-key signature with domain separator; canonical anchoring; version monotonicity; supersedes-on-replace.
- **Recipe resolution.** Index lookup; content-hash verification; version pinning.
- **ParserSpec semantics (PSP-1..PSP-5).** Match-predicate evaluation per format (jsonPath/selector/xPath/matcher); decision mapping (parse-fail → error not fail; negative-match inversion via `negativeMatch`); `indeterminateOn` predicates evaluated before the match predicate → indeterminate; dataMap extraction recorded without changing the decision; deterministic parsing with no script execution / sub-resource fetch / redirect following; **PSP-5 negative-match completeness floor — a truncated/partial full-list download MUST NOT return `pass` ("not listed"); completeness (record-count / sentinel / Content-Length) confirmed before any negative clear, else indeterminate.**
- **Retry semantics (VP-R1..VP-R4).** Transient retry on error; permanent no-retry; new attestation on each retry; no-retry-on-indeterminate by default; retryOnIndeterminate flag honoured when set.
- **Caching semantics (VP-C1..VP-C3).** Reuse within validUntil; record-update on reuse; maxAge override of recipe default.
- **Aggregation.** Each branch of classify_required: missing, all-failing, all-indeterminate, all-errored, mixed-with-pass. oneOf groups: failure vs error vs indeterminate distinction. Precedence: failures > errors > indeterminates when classifying overall.
- **Recipe and rail availability (§7.4.5, §9.4.4).** Every value in the closed enum produces the conformant orchestrator/verifier behaviour: RAV-1 through RAV-4 for recipes consumer-side (no silent treatment as live; consumer surfacing; disabled/failed → error in aggregation; alternative availability not inheriting from default) and RAV-5 through RAV-7 steward-side (emergency revision on failure; availability transitions are signed/anchored revisions; availability is per-recipe-version); RAV-R1 through RAV-R5 for rails (preflight inspection; no selection of disabled/failed; rail-down-at-settlement-attempt maps to substrate errorClass; RAV-R5 availability read from the authoritative signed/anchored rail definition, not a poisonable cache).
- **Phase contract (VPC-1..VPC-4).** Order (Vet after Identify, before Negotiate); two-sided execution; anchor-before-return; fail-or-indeterminate handling.
- **Matching algorithm (MA-1..MA-3, §6.3.3).** required/oneOf satisfaction; primaryClaimSelector scheme match (MA-2: presentedBy scheme != selector → REJECT); presentedBy verification (MA-3: primaryClaimSelector set + presentedBy claim unverified, i.e. missing/failing verifiedBy → REJECT, even when the structural scheme matches).

### 14.3 DACS-3 — Negotiate

- **Channel envelope.** Signature with channelmsg domain separator; sequence monotonicity; signature scope (excludes transport fields).
- **Channel failure detection.** Liveness-bound exceeded → channel-failed classification; abort message round-trip.
- **negotiate-fixed-price.** Live signature path; auto-accept commitment + instance-signature path; rejection of pre-issued per-instance signatures.
- **negotiate-rfq (RFQ-1..RFQ-4).** maxTurns enforcement; turn-timeout enforcement; out-of-band-terms rejection by commit-agreement.
- **negotiate-sealed-envelope (SE-1..SE-7).** commitDeadline enforcement (chain-timestamped); reveal-window enforcement against SR-2 anchor timestamp (SE-3); reveal-mismatch exclusion; deterministic selection with anchor-timestamp tie-break and lexicographic-bidHash fallback (SE-5); rule-ref content-hash binding and mismatch-fails-the-phase (SE-6); domain-separated bidHash (`dacs-sealed-bid:v1:`) and bid-commitment salt floor — ≥256-bit entropy, non-reuse, base64url encoding (SE-7).
- **Pattern selection (PS-1..PS-3).** Exactly-one-negotiate phase per pipeline; commit-agreement immediately follows the negotiate phase; the selected pattern is compatible with the listing's pricing model (§8.8).
- **Agreement validation (§8.5.2).** Price-band check; rail-acceptance check; deliverable-conformance check; deadline-bound check; pattern-match check; `priceAnchor` when present: `attestationRef` MUST resolve to a valid SR-3 attestation, `price` MUST be CD-1 canonical — implementations MUST NOT reject an otherwise-valid agreement solely because `priceAnchor` is absent.
- **commit-agreement (CA-1..CA-4).** Refuse advance until ok-true; double-commit rejection; immutability after anchor; domain-separated commitment signature.

### 14.4 DACS-4 — Settle

- **Rail authoring (RD-1..RD-5).** Steward-key signature with domain separator; anchoring; version monotonicity; railType/asset/network consistency.
- **Payment common contract (PC-1..PC-6).** For each of the six pay-* phases: input-shape validation; anchored SettlementEvidence; PhaseHandlerResult with correct attestationRef; outcome classification across all errorClass values; currency-resolution (PC-5) — `amount.currency` MUST resolve to `rail.asset` per AssetSpec kind (symbol for erc20/spl/native, isoCurrency for fiat-via-ap2, canonicalSymbol for stablecoin-cross-chain) and a mismatch MUST be rejected as `ok:false`/`errorClass:"permanent"`; settlement-finality population (PC-6) — a `success`-outcome payment evidence record MUST carry a `settlementFinality` field with the correct `model` for the rail and the `finalityBlocks` or `commitmentLevel` parameter sourced from rail.parameters (echoed into the record's `finalityBlocks` / `finalityCommitmentLevel` fields), and a delivery evidence record MUST NOT carry `settlementFinality`.
- **pay-evm-erc20 / pay-solana-spl.** Decimal-conversion correctness (no float arithmetic); chain-finality wait; SettlementEvidence with correct txRef kind.
- **Canonical decimal (CD-1).** PriceTerm.amount canonicalisation: economically-equal forms (`"1.50"`, `"01.5"`, `"1.500"`) all normalise to `"1.5"` and produce identical agreement/SettlementEvidence JCS hashes and signatures; non-canonical input on read either canonicalises or is rejected per implementation policy; §8.5.2 price-band and price-equality checks compare canonicalised decimals, not raw strings.
- **pay-cross-chain-htlc (HTLC-1..HTLC-10).** buyerSalt entropy enforcement; HKDF preimage-derivation correctness (IKM=buyerSalt, salt=jobId, info=agreementHash) with input-uniqueness (unique jobId / collision-resistant agreementHash); salt-non-reuse across sessions; salt-confidentiality enforcement (buyerSalt MUST NOT be disclosed to any non-payer party at any point during an active swap, HTLC-2); **canonical claim order** — payer (preimage holder) locks the longer-timelock source (beneficiary = payee), payee locks the shorter-timelock destination (beneficiary = payer), payer claims the destination first (revealing), payee then claims the source; timelock-refund path; per-chain native hashlock functions (keccak256 on EVM, sha256 on Solana, blake2b on Cosmos) producing distinct hashlocks from the same preimage; timelock asymmetry (timelock_source > timelock_dest + finality, finality margin ≥ 2× dest P99 latency) enforced on absolute expiry instants under the source-lock-finality epoch (HTLC-7/HTLC-8), with mis-configured routes rejected; asymmetric-settlement (dest-revealed / source-claim-pending — payer received on destination, payee owed source) surfaced as evidence, not a refund, and resolved through the non-terminal `settle-asymmetric` state (HTLC-9 / ST-8): an `htlc-claim` within the `expiry_source` window resolves forward to `completed`, window-expiry to terminal `failed-counterparty`; free-option disclosure (HTLC-10).
- **Amendment validity (AMEND-1..AMEND-4).** `amendsEvidenceRef` resolves to an anchored SettlementEvidence with matching `jobId` (AMEND-1); refund / partial-refund amendments reference a `success`-outcome record only, and `correction` carries no `refundAmount` (AMEND-2); summed `refundAmount` across amendments for one record does not exceed its `paymentAmount`, currency-matched (AMEND-3); bundle assembly rejects or flags violating amendments and a flagged amendment is not treated as a valid unwind by DACS-5 (AMEND-4).
- **pay-cross-chain-liquidity-tank.** BridgeOperation lifecycle ("empty" → "pending" → "completed" | "failed"); bridge_id recording; route-in-supported-scope validation.
- **pay-ap2 / pay-x402.** Mandate-revocation handling; receipt-signature verification.
- **Delivery phases.** deliver-storage-program with normal and extended-pointer payloads; deliver-entitlement with signature + anchor + scope; deliver-attested-payload composing DACS-2 attestation.
- **Pipeline (PIPE-1..PIPE-5).** At-least-one-deliver (pay-* optional — intake-only / out-of-band-settlement listings are valid, reconciled with §6.3.4(8)); deterministic ordering; pay-before-deliver ordering; deliver-before-pay ordering; phase repetition.

### 14.5 DACS-5 — Verify

- **Session state transitions.** Every `(from → to)` pair MUST be in the §10.3.1 transition table and no other; illegal-pair rejection (e.g. negotiate after commit, ST-1); abort entry from any `*-pending` (ST-3); rate branch and rate-non-fatal (ST-4/ST-5); substrate-failure pause → recorded-pending resume on success and → failed-substrate on timeout (ST-7); the cross-chain asymmetric open state (ST-8) — `settle-pending → settle-asymmetric` on the HTLC-9 condition, `settle-asymmetric → settle-completed` when the `htlc-claim` lands within the `expiry_source` window, `settle-asymmetric → settle-failed` on window expiry — and that `settle-asymmetric` is non-terminal (produces no bundle until it resolves); every terminal state maps to its §10.3.1 `outcome` (ST-6 + the state→outcome table).
- **Bundle production.** Two-sided anchoring at role-specific addresses; canonical-form equality between buyer and seller bundles in happy case; domain-separated signature ("dacs-bundle:v1:"); extended-pointer pattern for oversized bundles.
- **Bundle consumption.** Two-sided lookup; one-sided-bundle → aborted-by-self classification; divergent-bundles → the consumer fetches both party addresses, detects canonical divergence, and applies the §10.4.3(d) per-party policy (buyer's bundle for buyer-reputation, seller's for seller-reputation). "disputed" is a **consumer-side verdict**, not an `AttestationBundle.outcome` value (the outcome enum has no `disputed` member) — the test asserts the observable §10.4.3(d) behaviour, not an enum label.
- **Reputation derivation.** All outcome partitions (completed / failed-perm / failed-counterparty / failed-substrate / aborted-by-self / aborted-by-other); party-fault denominator excluding failed-substrate; null vs zero metric distinction; rating aggregation via ratingRefs fetch. **Two-sided reconciliation (§10.5.1):** when both anchored copies of one jobId are in the input, the deriver collapses to one authoritative bundle per jobId (one outcome counted, not two) — an abort-by-W scored against victim V MUST yield exactly one `aborted-by-other` for V and zero `aborted-by-self`, and when only the counterparty-anchored copy exists the `perspective_flip` (`aborted-by-self ↔ aborted-by-other`, `failed-perm ↔ failed-counterparty`) attributes the hit correctly. **Rating de-duplication (§10.5.1):** a session whose two copies share `(rater, jobId, targetRole)` rating refs contributes exactly one rating (last-writer-wins by `ratedAt`).
- **Per-primary-claim keying.** Reputation computed against the bundle party's primaryClaim (sourced from bundle.presentedBy); no inheritance across tiers.
- **Category-scoped derivation (§10.5.4).** Bundle set filtered to matching `categoryScope` prefix before applying §10.5.1; non-resolving agreementRefs excluded; categoryScope prefix-match rule (exact match OR `category + "."` prefix); a bundle outside the scope is excluded, not counted as a failure; `ReputationHint.categoryScope` accurately reflects the scope used.
- **Rate phase.** Run-after-settle ordering; one-record-per-direction; signature with rating domain separator; bundle-inclusion; RT-1 producer-reject of out-of-range `value` (non-integer or ∉[1,5]) / over-length `freeText`; RT-2 deriver-exclude of a non-conforming self-signed rating from the average; `dimensions` treated as opaque (not aggregated).
- **ERC-8004 publication (optional).** Token-owner-signed entry; bundle-anchor pointer correctness; rate-limit enforcement.

### 14.6 Universal signature scheme & canonical form (SIG-1..SIG-5, CF-1..CF-4, CD-1)

A cross-cutting test category that every conforming implementation runs once:

- Sign every artifact kind in §7.7 with a known key; verify with the same key against the domain-separated payload; reject if the verifier reconstructs without the separator.
- Cross-artifact replay test: take a valid signature on artifact kind A, attempt to verify it as a signature on artifact kind B with the same hash bytes; verification MUST fail.
- Unknown-artifact x-* prefix test: implementations encountering an unknown domain separator MUST reject; experimental x- separators MUST be accepted only with out-of-band agreement.
- **CF-1 (NFC).** A document carrying a non-ASCII identifier supplied in NFD form MUST hash and verify identically to the same document supplied in NFC form; a verifier MUST normalise before recomputing the canonical form.
- **CF-2/CF-3 (ClaimReference canonical form & identity).** `CCI-LEI:…` and `cci-lei:…` MUST produce identical content hashes when embedded in a signed document (scheme case-folded). Two references differing only in parameter order MUST produce identical canonical bytes; two references differing only in the presence/value of parameters MUST resolve to the same reputation key (parameters excluded from identity).
- **CF-4 (logical-address encoding).** A logical address built from a multi-colon primary claim MUST round-trip: assemble → derive native address → split the logical address back into `{sellerPrimaryClaim, listingId, listingVersion}` and percent-decode each to the exact originals. An address whose variable segments are left raw (unescaped) MUST be rejected as malformed.
- **CD-1 (canonical decimal).** `"1.50"` and `"1.5"` as `PriceTerm.amount` MUST produce identical agreement hashes and signatures.
- **SIG-5 (preserve-unknown).** A verifier built against schema vN MUST successfully verify the signature on a document produced under vN+1 that adds an unknown field, by hashing the document as received (unknown field included); a verifier that strips the unknown field before hashing (and thus rejects) FAILS this test.

### 14.7 Governance (GOV-1..GOV-3)

- **GOV-1 steward disclosure.** A registry consumer surfaces which signing key it treats as authoritative and does not present the single steward as a constituted multi-party body.
- **GOV-2 anchoring-phase disclosure.** An implementation discloses its operating phase (in-code / single-signer / multisig).
- **GOV-3 anchoring-phase verification.** A consumer reads the resolved recipe's `governance.anchoring` and evaluates each pinned recipeVersion against the phase recorded at pin time; a recipe marked `in-code` is not treated as canonically anchored.

### 14.8 Substrate-capability tests

For substrates other than Demos that claim conformance, additional capability tests apply:

- **SR-1.** Sub-identity binding test: a root key binds N sub-identities, presents under a single SR-1 signature, verifier resolves each to its claim scheme.
- **SR-2.** Anchor-write → retrieve → content-hash check round-trip; size-cap enforcement.
- **SR-3.** Fetch-specification → consensus-signed commitment → anchor; body-hash verification by independent consumer. (v0.1 conformance bar is trust-property; v2 will add wire-protocol tests.)
- **SR-4.** Channel-establish → member-only-message-delivery → non-member-cannot-read; CH-1..CH-6 each as a test (CH-6: channelId unique per session — cross-session offer-replay rejected). (v0.1 trust-property; v2 wire-protocol.)
- **SR-5.** Cross-chain lock → release with bounded-time atomicity; refund path on counterparty timeout.

### 14.9 Out of scope for v0.1 conformance

The following are not part of v0.1 conformance and SHOULD NOT be tested as such:

- Cross-substrate interoperability for SR-3- or SR-4-dependent phases (deferred to v2).
- Multi-party transactions beyond bilateral plus sealed-envelope (deferred).
- Streaming / continuous-flow rails (deferred).
- Cross-DACS-version pipelines (deferred).
- Dispute *resolution* flows (DACS-X, anticipated). Divergence *detection* — the two-sided lookup plus canonical-divergence classification and per-party policy of §10.4.3(d) — **is** in scope for v0.1 conformance; only the resolution layer is deferred.
