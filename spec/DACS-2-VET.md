# DACS-2: Vet — Vet

*Normative module of DACS v0.1. Read the [Primer](../PRIMER.md) first; shared types, signatures, canonical form, the session model, and substrate requirements live in [CORE](CORE.md). Section numbers are retained from the unified specification; per the §→document map in [CORE](CORE.md), cross-references of the form §6–§10 point to sibling module documents, and §A / §12–§14 to the companion references (Demos mapping, threat model, glossary, conformance plan). The [conformance vectors](../conformance/) exercise this module's rules.*

## Chapter 7 — DACS-2: Vet

**Stage:** Vet (2nd of 5). **Status:** Draft (part of DACS v0.1). **Depends on:** SR-2 (required), SR-3 (required for consensus-backed-proxy and evm-rpc methods); composes with W3C VC, TLSNotary, zkTLS / Reclaim. **Used by:** DACS-1 (claim verification), DACS-3 (pre-negotiation gate), DACS-5 (audit references).

### 7.1 Abstract

DACS-2 specifies how a party's claimed credentials are verified against authoritative sources during the Vet stage. It defines:

- A **verification method registry** — a closed set (`verifiable-credential`, `tlsnotary`, `zktls`, `consensus-backed-proxy`, `oauth-attested`, `evm-rpc`, `domain-tls-control`, `self-signed`), each with input/output shape, trust model, and substrate requirements.
- A **recipe registry** — a versioned, anchored lookup binding a DACS-1 claim scheme (`lei`, `finra-crd`, `domain`, …) to the method and parsing rules used to verify it.
- A **uniform VerifyResult** — the method-agnostic, anchored record the rest of the stack consumes (decision, attestation reference, extracted data).
- A **composite verification record** — the anchored artifact Vet produces, aggregating freshness checks, supplementary signals, and deal-specific claims; referenced by DACS-5.
- A **vet-credentials phase** — the phase the orchestrator invokes over the counterparty's bundle and the listing's requirement, emitting the composite record.

Vet does three jobs and produces one output (the composite verification record) that the rest of the transaction — and a future auditor, regulator, or arbitrator — references.

### 7.2 Motivation

The Vet stage answers two questions before progressing past vet-credentials:

- *Is the counterparty's bundle valid right now?* Claims assembled months ago may have lapsed registrations, updated sanctions lists, or expired certifications.
- *Is it sufficient for this specific deal?* The listing may require deal-specific claims the bundle was never pre-attested for.

A one-shot check at session start fails for three reasons:

- **Freshness** — existing standards attest at issuance; Vet must re-check against current authority state and produce a current attestation superseding the stale one.
- **Supplementary signals** — reputation, completion history, dispute rates, and prior ratings inform the decision without being formal credentials.
- **Deal-specific claims** — some claims exist only for this transaction (insurance binding, project clearance) and aren't reused.

Two further design failures DACS-2 avoids:

- Treating each method as its own protocol. The uniform `VerifyResult` is the lingua franca — methods produce it, the stack consumes it.
- Forcing one method onto all credentials. Public-registry credentials fit consensus-backed proxy/SR-3; private-data fit TLSNotary/zkTLS; cooperative-issuer fit W3C VC. The recipe registry routes each scheme; the stack stays method-agnostic.

### 7.3 Verification methods (v0.1 closed registry)

The v0.1 method set is closed. New methods are added in subsequent versions of DACS-2 by the governance process in chapter 11.

#### 7.3.1 Common contract

Every method MUST:

- **(CM-1)** accept inputs as specified in its sub-section;
- **(CM-2)** anchor its attestation via SR-2 at an address derived from the session id, claim scheme, and identifier:

  `dacs2:{jobId}:{scheme}:{identifier}:v{recipeVersion}`

  (or substrate-equivalent) — `{identifier}` is a CF-4 variable segment and MUST be percent-encoded before assembly (CORE §B.1);
- **(CM-3)** produce a VerifyResult conforming to §7.5;
- **(CM-4)** classify its outcome as exactly one of `pass`, `fail`, `indeterminate`, or `error` per the semantics in §7.5.1;
- **(CM-5)** set `VerifyResult.method` to its own kind.

#### 7.3.2 verifiable-credential

```
type VCMethodInput = {
  recipe: Recipe
  identifier: string                   // claim identifier (must match VC subject)
  presentation: VerifiablePresentation
  issuerAllowList?: ClaimReference[]
}
```

**Procedure.** The verifier runs these steps:

1. **Parse** the presentation.
2. **Verify the VC signature** against the issuer key (resolved per the VC method).
3. **Issuer allow-list** — if `issuerAllowList` is set, MUST reject if the VC issuer is not in the list.
4. **Validity** — verify the VC has not expired and is not revoked (via status list, if present).
5. **Subject match** — verify the VC’s subject identifier matches the claim’s identifier canonically.
6. **Holder-binding proof** — verify the VerifiablePresentation's holder-binding proof: the presentation MUST be signed by the key controlling the credential subject (the holder), over a challenge that includes the bundle's session nonce (see *Session-nonce binding* below). MUST reject if the holder proof is absent or does not verify.
7. **Anchor** the VC (or its hash, if the VC is private) via SR-2.
8. **Extract** structured data per `recipe.parserRules`.
9. **Return** a VerifyResult (see *Outcome* below).

*Session-nonce binding.* The challenge nonce is, per the §6.3.2 disjunction, the SIWD message `Nonce` for a `siwd`-presented bundle, else the top-level `bundleToVet.sessionNonce` (a SIWD-presented bundle does NOT populate the top-level field, so a VC claim inside one binds to the SIWD Nonce). This is the same session nonce the presentation check validated (Vet runs before DACS-3, so the bundle nonce is the comparison target). Without it, a verified VC captured from one party could be replayed by a non-holder, or re-presented across sessions — verifying the VC's issuer signature alone proves the credential is genuine, not that the presenter holds it.

*Outcome.* `pass` if all steps succeed; `fail` on signature/expiry/revocation/holder-binding failures; `error` on parser failures (a verifier-side failure to consume the presentation — never `fail`; consistent with PSP-2 and the §7.5.1 decision semantics, so it is retryable per VP-R1 rather than treated as a terminal authority answer); a parseable-but-inconclusive presentation is `indeterminate`.

**Trust model:** issuer; W3C VC spec; key resolution method (e.g. did:web). **Substrate:** SR-2.

#### 7.3.3 tlsnotary

```
type TLSNotaryMethodInput = {
  recipe: Recipe
  identifier: string
  proof: TLSNotaryProof                // MPC-derived TLS session commitment + notary signature
  sessionTemplate?: string
}
```

**Procedure.** Validates the TLSNotary proof per the TLSNotary specification (current PSE rebuild); verifies the notary signature against a known notary public key registry; if sessionTemplate is set, verifies the proof targets that endpoint and protocol; anchors the proof commitment via SR-2; applies parser rules to any disclosed segments; returns VerifyResult per outcome. **Trust model:** TLS PKI; notary honesty; MPC computational assumptions. **Substrate:** SR-2.

#### 7.3.4 zktls

```
type ZKTLSMethodInput = {
  recipe: Recipe
  identifier: string
  provider: "reclaim" | "pluto" | string
  programId: string
  proof: ZKTLSProof
}
```

**Procedure.** Loads the verifier circuit for provider:programId; verifies the zk proof per the circuit’s verification algorithm; verifies any public inputs match expected values; anchors the proof + public-input hash via SR-2; applies parser rules to public-input disclosed data; returns VerifyResult per outcome. **Trust model:** zk soundness; provider’s circuit correctness; TLS PKI; proxy honesty (provider-dependent). **Substrate:** SR-2.

#### 7.3.5 consensus-backed-proxy

```
type ConsensusProxyMethodInput = {
  recipe: Recipe
  identifier: string
  endpoint: {
    method: "GET" | "POST"
    urlTemplate: string                // e.g. "https://api.gleif.org/api/v1/lei-records/{identifier}"
    headers?: Record<string, string>
    body?: string
  }
}
```

**Procedure.** Renders the URL by substituting {identifier} and other recipe parameters into urlTemplate; submits the fetch specification to the substrate’s SR-3 primitive (on Demos: dahr.startProxy({url, method, options})); the substrate returns the response body inline plus chain-anchored commitment hashes (responseHash, responseHeadersHash) via a one-tx web2Request. Anchors the commitment record via SR-2; applies parser rules to the response body; if recipe.negativeMatch is true (OFAC pattern): decision = "pass" when the parser finds no match, "fail" when a match is found; otherwise pass when the parser matches expected success criteria.

**Trust model in v0.1 — consensus-anchored hash commitment.** The substrate validator set collectively signs the on-chain transaction that asserts "we fetched URL X at time T and obtained a response with hash H." The full response body is **not** independently signed by the validator set in v0.1; the chain-level guarantee is "this hash came from this URL at this time," not "this body content is validator-attested." Verifiers consuming the body MUST verify the body’s hash matches the on-chain commitment.

**Trust caveats v0.1 implementations MUST surface to consumers.**

- (a) A validator-set majority that colludes can sign a commitment to a forged response; the body the consumer reads will hash to the committed value, so consumers cannot detect this from the commitment alone.
- (b) A single validator fetching the response and the rest signing the resulting hash is operationally indistinguishable from a full-fanout fetch under current SR-3 specs; recipes used for high-stakes verification SHOULD set multi-method alternatives (see §7.12).
- (c) The TLS connection between substrate validators and the authority is the trust floor for response authenticity at fetch time; an attacker who can MITM the authority’s TLS endpoint can cause all validators to commit to forged content.

**v0.2 strengthening (planned).** A future minor version is expected to specify a "validator-body-signed" mode in which each validator independently signs the response body bytes and the aggregate signature is anchored. When this mode ships, recipes for high-stakes schemes (lei, finra-crd, ofac-clear, sam-uei) SHOULD migrate to require it. v0.1 recipes that already declare alternatives are forward-compatible.

**Substrate:** SR-3 (proxy attestation primitive); SR-2 (anchoring).

**Note on the tlsn CCI context.** TLSNotary proofs are a native CCI context on Demos (cci-tlsn:<proof-hash>), validated by Demos’s GCR routines. When the proof is already registered as a cci-tlsn claim in the counterparty’s bundle, Vet treats it as a CCI-native verification (the tlsn GCR routine has already validated it) and does NOT re-run the external tlsnotary method. The external tlsnotary method applies only when an *unregistered* proof is presented at session time.

#### 7.3.6 oauth-attested

```
type OAuthAttestedMethodInput = {
  recipe: Recipe
  identifier: string
  provider: string                     // e.g. "google", "github"
  scopes: string[]
  maxTokenAgeSec: number               // recipe-required
  attestation: OAuthAttestationEnvelope
}
```

**Procedure.** The verifier runs these steps:

1. **Validate** the attestation envelope’s signature.
2. **Identifier match** — verify the attestation references an OAuth flow that resolved to the claimed identifier (e.g. the `sub` claim from a Google ID token matches).
3. **Scopes** — verify the granted scopes include those required by the recipe.
4. **Session binding** — verify the attestation is bound to this session: the attestation challenge/nonce MUST include the bundle's session nonce (the §6.3.2 disjunction, as defined under *Session-nonce binding* in §7.3.2), and the verifier MUST reject an envelope whose nonce does not match it. This is the same anti-replay requirement as the §7.3.2 holder-binding rule — a captured envelope cannot be replayed by a non-holder or across sessions within `maxTokenAgeSec`. If the attestation service cannot carry a nonce, the recipe MUST document the residual replay risk.
5. **Anchor** the attestation via SR-2.
6. **Return** a VerifyResult.

**Trust model:** OAuth provider; attestation service honesty; TLS PKI. **Substrate:** SR-2 (SR-3 if the attestation service is the substrate’s API Verification primitive).

#### 7.3.7 evm-rpc

```
type EVMRPCMethodInput = {
  recipe: Recipe
  identifier: string
  chainId: number
  contract: string                     // 0x address
  method: string                       // contract method name or selector
  args?: unknown[]                     // ABI-encoded arguments
}
```

**Procedure.** Submits a proxy-attested EVM call via SR-3 (typically wrapped as a JSON-RPC fetch); substrate validator set executes the call and signs the result; anchors the signed result via SR-2; decodes the return value per recipe parser rules; compares the decoded value to the claim’s identifier (e.g., owner address of an ERC-8004 token); returns VerifyResult. **Trust model:** substrate consensus; EVM chain finality. **Substrate:** SR-3; SR-2.

#### 7.3.8 domain-tls-control

```
type DomainTLSControlMethodInput = {
  recipe: Recipe
  identifier: string                   // the domain
  challengeType: "http-01" | "dns-01" | "tls-alpn-01"
  challenge: Challenge
  response: ChallengeResponse
}
```

**Procedure.** Validates the challenge/response per the ACME-style challenge specification; confirms response was retrievable from the claimed domain at the time of the challenge; anchors the challenge/response transcript via SR-2; returns VerifyResult (pass on valid response, fail on invalid, indeterminate on retrieval failure). **Trust model:** DNS / TLS PKI; ACME challenge integrity. **Substrate:** SR-2.

#### 7.3.9 self-signed

```
type SelfSignedMethodInput = {
  recipe: Recipe
  identifier: string                   // hex public key
  signature: string                    // signature over the claim assertion
  assertion: string                    // canonical bytes signed
}
```

**Procedure.** Validates the signature against the key in identifier; anchors the signed assertion via SR-2; returns VerifyResult with pass on valid signature, fail on invalid. This method provides minimal trust — it proves possession of the key, nothing more. Recipes targeting authority-issued schemes MUST NOT use self-signed. **Trust model:** cryptographic signature. **Substrate:** SR-2.

### 7.4 Recipe registry

A recipe binds a DACS-1 claim scheme to a verification method (or set of acceptable methods) plus parsing rules and defaults.

#### 7.4.1 Recipe schema

```
type Recipe = {

  recipeVersion: number                       // monotonic per scheme; starts at 1

  scheme: string

  defaultMethod: VerificationMethod

  alternatives?: VerificationMethod[]

  defaultMaxAgeSec: number                    // when a verifiedBy reference becomes stale

  parserRules: ParserSpec

  backoff?: { strategy: "exponential" | "fixed"; baseMs?: number }  // default exponential (see §7.6.1 VP-R1)

  availability: RecipeAvailability            // operational status (see §7.4.5)

  governance: {

    proposedBy: ClaimReference

    acceptedAt: number

    supersedes?: number

    anchoring: "in-code" | "single-signer" | "multisig"   // progressive-anchoring phase (PA-1/PA-2/PA-3); see §7.4.4

    emergency?: {                              // present iff this is an emergency revision; see §7.4.4

      isEmergency: true

      failureObservation: string               // URL of authority change / observed response-format diff

    }

    deprecated?: boolean                       // true => MUST NOT start new sessions for required claims; see §7.4.4

    deprecationReason?: string                 // required when deprecated is true

  }

  signature: RecipeSignature                  // steward's signature (see §7.4.4)

}

type RecipeAvailability =

  | "live"            // authority endpoint reachable, attestation path runs end-to-end

  | "operator_gated"  // requires per-operator credential, key, or whitelisting

  | "closed_data"     // authority data not publicly accessible (e.g., paid feed, internal source)

  | "bilateral"       // requires per-relationship agreement between parties

  | "mocked"          // attestation path stubbed; not a production verification

  | "disabled"        // recipe present but the steward has marked it not-for-use

  | "failed"          // recipe's underlying authority is currently broken or unreachable

type VerificationMethod =

  | { kind: "verifiable-credential"; issuerAllowList?: ClaimReference[]; schemaUrl?: string }

  | { kind: "tlsnotary"; endpoint: string; sessionTemplate?: string }

  | { kind: "zktls"; provider: "reclaim" | "pluto" | string; programId: string }

  | { kind: "consensus-backed-proxy"; endpoint: { method: "GET" | "POST"; urlTemplate: string; headers?: Record<string, string>; body?: string } }

  | { kind: "oauth-attested"; provider: string; scopes: string[]; maxTokenAgeSec: number }

  | { kind: "evm-rpc"; chainId: number; contract: string; method: string; args?: unknown[] }

  | { kind: "domain-tls-control"; challengeType: "http-01" | "dns-01" | "tls-alpn-01" }

  | { kind: "self-signed" }

type IndeterminatePredicate =

  | { jsonPath: string } | { selector: string } | { xPath: string } | { matcher: string }

type ParserSpec =

  | { format: "json"; successJsonPath: string; indeterminateOn?: IndeterminatePredicate[]; dataMap?: Record<string, string> }

  | { format: "html"; successSelector: string; indeterminateOn?: IndeterminatePredicate[]; dataMap?: Record<string, string> }

  | { format: "xml"; successXPath: string; indeterminateOn?: IndeterminatePredicate[]; dataMap?: Record<string, string> }

  | { format: "raw"; matcher: string; indeterminateOn?: IndeterminatePredicate[] }
```

**ParserSpec semantics (normative).** Given the attested response body, a verifier applies the recipe’s ParserSpec to produce a decision and an optional extracted-data map:

- (PSP-1) **successJsonPath / successSelector / successXPath / matcher** is the *match predicate*. For `json`, it is a JSONPath that MUST select at least one node for a match; for `html`, a CSS selector that MUST select at least one element; for `xml`, an XPath that MUST select at least one node; for `raw`, `matcher` is a regular expression (RE2 syntax, no backreferences) that MUST find at least one match in the body.
- (PSP-2) **Decision mapping.** Schemes have a *match polarity*: for a **positive-match** scheme (e.g. `lei`) a match means the claim holds; for a **negative-match** scheme (e.g. `ofac-clear`, where a match means "listed") the recipe’s `negativeMatch: true` flag inverts the outcome. The `indeterminateOn` predicates, when present, are evaluated against the parsed body BEFORE the match predicate; if any matches, the decision is `indeterminate` and the match predicate is not applied. Otherwise:

  | Body parses? | Match predicate | positive-match scheme | negative-match scheme |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | yes | matches | `pass` | `fail` (match = "listed") |
  | yes | no match | `fail` | `pass` |
  | no — malformed JSON/HTML/XML, parser exception | — | `error` (verifier-side failure to obtain a decision, never `fail`) | `error` |
  | authority signals "no conclusive answer" (a pending/partial-record marker listed in `indeterminateOn`) | — | `indeterminate` | `indeterminate` |

  Each predicate uses the expression kind appropriate to the declared `format` (`jsonPath` for `json`, `selector` for `html`, `xPath` for `xml`, `matcher` for `raw`).
- (PSP-3) **dataMap** maps output field names to JSONPath/selector/XPath expressions evaluated against the same body; each resolved value is recorded in the VerifyResult’s extracted data for audit. A `dataMap` expression that resolves to nothing is recorded as null and MUST NOT by itself change the decision.
- (PSP-4) Parser evaluation MUST be deterministic and MUST NOT execute scripts, fetch sub-resources, or follow redirects embedded in the body.
- (PSP-5) **Negative-match completeness floor.** For a negative-match scheme whose decision rests on the *absence* of the identifier in a full-list download (e.g. `ofac-clear` over SDN.XML), the verifier MUST confirm the response is **complete** before returning the negative (`pass` = "not listed") outcome. It MUST check the received response against a completeness signal — the authority's declared record-count / list-size field, a documented end-of-list sentinel, or the HTTP `Content-Length` matching the received byte count — and MUST NOT return `pass` on a response that is truncated, partial, or whose completeness cannot be confirmed (→ `indeterminate`). *Why:* a truncated-but-parseable SDN download in which the searched entity merely fell outside the received bytes would otherwise clear a sanctioned party; absence MUST be trusted only over a provably-complete response. PSP-5 applies to any `negativeMatch: true` recipe whose match predicate is "identifier not found in a downloaded list".

*Worked example (`lei`, positive-match, GLEIF JSON-API):*

```
recipe.parserRules = {
  format: "json",
  successJsonPath: "$.data[0].attributes.lei",   // present iff GLEIF holds this LEI
  dataMap: {
    legalName:   "$.data[0].attributes.entity.legalName.name",
    status:      "$.data[0].attributes.entity.status",     // "ACTIVE" | "INACTIVE"
    jurisdiction:"$.data[0].attributes.entity.jurisdiction"
  }
}
// Body parses as JSON and successJsonPath selects a node  -> decision = pass
// Body parses as JSON but successJsonPath selects nothing  -> decision = fail
// Body is not valid JSON / GLEIF returns a 5xx HTML error  -> decision = error
// (extracted legalName/status/jurisdiction recorded in the VerifyResult — these are public GLEIF registry fields, exempt from §7.5 public-anchor minimisation; a privacy-sensitive recipe MUST instead reduce private fields to predicate outcomes)
```

#### 7.4.2 v0.1 recipe registry contents

The v0.1 registry contains one recipe per scheme registered in chapter 6. Each recipe is anchored via SR-2 at a steward-controlled address. Implementations MUST resolve recipes from the canonical addresses listed in the recipe-registry index document (dacs2:registry:v0.1). Default methods per scheme:

| Scheme | Default method | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| key | self-signed | Lowest trust; session continuity only |
| did | verifiable-credential (DID-bound) or self-signed (key-bound) | Per DID method |
| erc8004 | evm-rpc | Reads token owner |
| lei | consensus-backed-proxy against api.gleif.org/api/v1/lei-records/{identifier} | JSON parser; GLEIF JSON-API |
| finra-crd | consensus-backed-proxy against api.brokercheck.finra.org/search/individual/{identifier} | JSON; FINRA BrokerCheck JSON API (not the HTML site) |
| sam-uei | consensus-backed-proxy against api.sam.gov/entity-information/v3/entities?ueiSAM={identifier} | JSON; SAM.gov Entity API |
| ofac-clear | consensus-backed-proxy against sanctionslistservice.ofac.treas.gov/api/PublicationPreview/exports/SDN.XML | XML; full SDN List download; negativeMatch: true; parser searches for {identifier} entity |
| fedramp | consensus-backed-proxy against marketplace.fedramp.gov/api/v1/products/{identifier} | JSON; FedRAMP Marketplace API |
| naics | consensus-backed-proxy against api.census.gov/data/2017/cbp?get=NAICS2017&NAICS2017={identifier} | JSON; US Census API for NAICS validation |
| cmmc | verifiable-credential preferred; consensus-backed-proxy fallback against cmmcab.org public registry endpoint | CMMC AB publishes both VC issuance and a registry |
| domain | domain-tls-control | ACME-style |
| platform:<provider> | oauth-attested | Provider-specific |
| stripe-connect | oauth-attested (provider="stripe") | Stripe-specific scopes |

**Authority API stability.** The endpoints above are the canonical structured-data endpoints offered by each authority as of v0.1 publication. Authority APIs change; recipes MUST be re-anchored when endpoint URLs or response formats change materially. See §7.4.4 for the recipe-track governance that makes this operational.

#### 7.4.3 Recipe authoring and resolution

A conforming recipe author MUST:

- (RA-1) sign the recipe with the registry steward’s signing key over the domain-separated payload "dacs-recipe:v1:" || recipe_hash per §B.7;
- (RA-2) anchor the recipe via SR-2 at the canonical address;
- (RA-3) specify recipeVersion as monotonically increasing per scheme;
- (RA-4) specify supersedes when replacing a prior recipe for the same scheme;
- (RA-5) provide at least one alternative method only if the scheme’s underlying authority supports multiple equivalent attestation paths.

A verifier MUST resolve a recipe by:

1. reading the recipe-registry index from dacs2:registry:v0.1;
2. looking up the entry for the claim’s scheme;
3. fetching the recipe at the indicated anchor and verifying its content hash and domain-separated signature;
4. if the matched `ClaimRequirement` pins a specific `recipeVersion` (§6.3.3), MUST use that version, otherwise MUST use the latest at session start, pinned into the session.

This mirrors the rail-side `railVersion` pin (§9.3) and is the mechanism that protects an in-flight session from a steward shipping a recipe revision mid-session.

#### 7.4.4 Recipe-track lifecycle and current steward

**Recipes are operational artifacts on a different lifecycle than the DACS-2 standard itself.** Authority API endpoints change, response formats evolve, sanctions lists update, OAuth provider scopes shift. Treating every recipe revision as a DACS-2 minor version would force the standard onto an impractical release cadence. v0.1 separates the two tracks:

- **DACS-2 standard releases** (this chapter) version on a multi-year cadence. They define the method registry, the VerifyResult shape, the recipe schema, the aggregation algorithm, the phase contract.
- **DACS-2 recipe releases** (the recipe registry) version per-scheme on whatever cadence the underlying authority demands. Recipe revisions ship under the steward’s signing key and do not block on DACS-2 standard releases.

**Current steward (v0.1).** The DACS-2 recipe registry is currently maintained by **KyneSys Labs** as the v0.1 steward. This is a single-signer arrangement (phase PA-2 per the progressive-anchoring scheme below). Wider governance — working-group constitution, multi-signature schemes, sub-authority delegation by domain (sanctions lists, financial regulation, etc.) — is open work for v0.2+ and depends on the eventual constitution of a multi-party body. v0.1 implementations and consumers reason about the registry under single-steward semantics: one signing key, one anchoring authority, full transparency about both.

**Emergency recipe updates.** When an authority endpoint becomes unavailable or returns materially-incompatible data, the steward MAY publish an emergency recipe revision. Emergency revisions MUST: be signed normally; include an emergency: true field in the governance block; cite the failure observation (URL of authority change announcement, observed response format diff). Emergency revisions take effect at next session start; in-flight sessions continue against pinned recipeVersion.

**Recipe deprecation.** A recipe MAY be marked deprecated by publishing a new revision with deprecated: true and a deprecationReason. Verifiers MUST NOT initiate new sessions using deprecated recipes for required claims; in-flight sessions continue. A deprecated recipe with no replacement leaves the scheme un-verifiable; this is a v0.2 strengthening target for any scheme that hits this condition.

**Progressive anchoring phases.** Recipe anchoring proceeds through three phases, recorded in the recipe's `governance.anchoring` field (§7.4.1):

| Phase | `anchoring` value | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (PA-1) Bootstrap | `in-code` | Implementations MAY ship recipes as in-code constants or static configuration. Recipes in this phase MUST be marked `anchoring: "in-code"` and MUST NOT be presented as canonically anchored. |
| (PA-2) Single-steward | `single-signer` | The steward (currently KyneSys Labs) anchors recipes at the canonical address under a single signature, marked `anchoring: "single-signer"` and disclosing the steward’s identity. **This is the current operating phase for v0.1.** |
| (PA-3) Constituted | `multisig` | If and when a multi-party governance body is constituted, recipes anchor under that body’s multi-signature scheme. |

**Append-only re-anchoring.** Re-anchoring is append-only: prior single-signer recipeVersions MUST remain anchored, immutable, and independently re-verifiable under the steward key and content hash recorded during the single-signer phase (PA-2). The constituted body re-anchors prior recipes only as NEW recipeVersions under its multi-signature scheme; it MUST NOT mutate the signer or content hash of an already-published recipeVersion. This preserves the monotonic recipe-version pinning that §7.12 and §12.4 depend on: a VerifyResult pinned to a recipeVersion during PA-2 MUST continue to validate against the anchoring phase and signing key in force at pin time, not the current registry state.

**Phase disclosure.** (GOV-2) Implementations MUST clearly disclose which phase they operate in. (GOV-3) Consumers reading a VerifyResult MUST verify the recipe’s anchoring phase against their own trust requirements, evaluating each pinned recipeVersion against the phase recorded at the time it was anchored. GOV-3 is satisfiable from the data the protocol exposes: the consumer already resolves the recipe to verify a VerifyResult (§7.4.3), and the resolved Recipe carries `governance.anchoring` (`in-code` / `single-signer` / `multisig`, §7.4.1) — that field is the machine-readable anchoring phase GOV-3 checks.

#### 7.4.5 Recipe availability (normative)

Every Recipe MUST declare an availability value. The value names the recipe’s current operational status — what a verifier should actually expect when it tries to run this attestation path. The values are deliberately discrete and disjoint so consumers can compose them programmatically without flattening operational reality into a single boolean.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| live | Authority endpoint reachable today; the attestation path runs end-to-end against a public or near-public source. The normal operating state for a recipe consumers expect to "just work". |
| operator_gated | Recipe technically functions but requires per-operator setup before it can run: API credentials, IP whitelisting, paid subscription, registered relationship with the authority. Consumers can’t rely on it working without operator-side configuration. |
| closed_data | Authority data not publicly accessible — paid feed, proprietary database, regulator-only API. Recipe shape is defined for forward compatibility but the path cannot run from an open verifier. |
| bilateral | Recipe runs only between parties with a pre-existing bilateral agreement (custom trust anchor, shared secret, contracted attestation service). The shape exists so DACS-2 can describe such verifications uniformly; the recipe doesn’t function for general open-network use. |
| mocked | Attestation path is stubbed for development, testing, or honest-scope visibility. MUST NOT be presented as a production verification path. Implementations MUST surface this state to consumers (e.g., via the "dahr-stub:" prefix marker on attestations). |
| disabled | Recipe exists but the steward has marked it not-for-use, typically because a successor recipe exists or the underlying scheme is being retired. Verifiers MUST NOT initiate new sessions using disabled recipes; in-flight sessions continue. |
| failed | Recipe’s underlying authority is currently broken (endpoint down, response format changed in a way the parser cannot consume, certificate expired). Operationally indistinguishable from "live but unreachable" until the steward publishes an emergency revision or marks the recipe disabled. |

**Consumer obligations.** Verifiers MUST inspect availability before running the recipe.

- (RAV-1) A verifier MUST NOT silently treat operator_gated, closed_data, bilateral, mocked, disabled, or failed as live.
- (RAV-2) A verifier presented with a VerifyResult produced under a non-live availability MUST surface the availability value to the verifier’s consumer; a UI flattening seven states into "verified" / "not verified" without disclosing availability is non-conformant.
- (RAV-3) Aggregation under §7.7.1 treats VerifyResults from disabled, failed, or **mocked** recipes as decision = "error" regardless of the underlying authority response (the recipe is non-operational or a stub; any output is unreliable). In particular a `mocked` recipe MUST NOT satisfy a required claim — its `pass` is a test fixture, not a verification. (`operator_gated` / `closed_data` / `bilateral` differ: they can run validly once the relevant operator-side configuration is in place, so they are not forced to `error`.)
- (RAV-4) The availability of an alternative method does not override the availability of the default; consumers selecting an alternative MUST honour that alternative’s own availability.

**Steward obligations.** The current steward (§7.4.4 and §11.1.1) MUST keep availability values current.

- (RAV-5) Discovery that an authority endpoint has gone down requires either an emergency revision (§7.4.4) or a recipe revision setting availability to failed within a reasonable window.
- (RAV-6) Transitions from live → failed and failed → live are themselves recipe revisions and MUST be signed and anchored normally.
- (RAV-7) Availability is per-recipe-version, not per-scheme; a v3 recipe MAY be live while a v2 recipe is disabled for the same scheme.
**Why this is normative, not informative.** Earlier drafts carried this distinction in the front-matter production-mapping legend as informative iconography (🟢 / 🟡 / 🔵). That framing flattened distinct operational states (live, operator-gated, closed-data, mocked, etc.) into a single "wired" status and pushed disambiguation onto every implementer’s UI surface. Promoting availability to a normative field on the recipe itself moves the disambiguation into the protocol layer, where verifiers can reason about it programmatically and consumers can rely on conformant disclosure. This change was proposed by PATH-OS Labs (third-party reviewer; §11.3) and accepted into v0.1.

### 7.5 VerifyResult

The uniform record every method produces.

```
type VerifyResult = {

  resultVersion: "1"

  scheme: string                              // DACS-1 claim scheme

  identifier: string                          // canonical identifier verified

  recipeVersion: number

  method: VerificationMethod["kind"]

  decision: "pass" | "fail" | "indeterminate" | "error"

  reason: string                              // brief

  attestation: AttestationRef

  data?: Record<string, unknown>              // structured extraction per recipe.parserRules

  fetchedAt: number                           // unix ms when the authority was queried

  verifiedAt: number                          // unix ms when the result was finalised

  validUntil?: number

  signature: VerifyResultSignature

}

type AttestationRef = {

  anchor: { kind: "storage-program" | "ipfs" | "https"; locator: string }

  contentHash: string

  signer?: ClaimReference                     // for VC: issuer; for proxy: substrate validator-set claim (see below)

}
```

The VerifyResult follows the §B.2 canonical-form template, omitting the `signature` field; the signature is computed over:
signed_bytes := "dacs-verifyresult:v1:" || verifyresult_hash

**Validator-set claim references.** When AttestationRef.signer designates the producer of a consensus-backed-proxy or evm-rpc attestation, the ClaimReference MUST use the substrate-validator-set scheme: substrate-validator-set:<substrateId>:<epochOrSetId>.

- <substrateId> is a registered substrate identifier (v0.1 registry: "demos-mainnet", "demos-testnet"; future substrates added by the registry steward).
- <epochOrSetId> identifies the specific validator set that signed the attestation. Demos uses epoch numbers; substrates using rotating sets use whatever identifier the substrate exposes.
- Consumers MUST resolve the validator-set reference to the substrate’s published validator-set roster for that epoch and verify the attestation signature against the aggregate of those validators’ keys per the substrate’s consensus protocol.
- Substrates whose validator-set rosters are not publicly resolvable MUST NOT be used as the signer of a VerifyResult intended for cross-substrate consumption.

**Public-anchor data minimisation (normative).** A VerifyResult is anchored at a publicly-derivable address (§7.3.1 CM-2) in cleartext, so its `data` field is world-readable. The rules:

- `data` in a publicly-anchored VerifyResult MUST carry **only predicate outcomes** — the booleans / derived facts the recipe's match needs (e.g. `{ overEighteen: true }`, `{ sanctioned: false }`, `{ kycTier: "enhanced" }`).
- `data` in a publicly-anchored VerifyResult MUST NOT carry raw extracted **private** personal or financial fields (date of birth, account balance, document/government-ID numbers) or any value a privacy-preserving method was used specifically to avoid disclosing. Carrying the raw fields is only permissible under the encrypted-to-parties anchoring mode that is roadmap work (§12.1).
- A recipe whose `parserRules` would extract such sensitive raw fields MUST reduce them to predicate outcomes before they enter an unencrypted anchored `data`.
- Fields that are **already public at the authority** — e.g. a public registry's published company name / jurisdiction, such as GLEIF LEI data — are NOT subject to this minimisation, since anchoring already-public registry data leaks nothing.

> **Note (non-normative).** This is load-bearing for privacy-preserving methods: a `tlsnotary` or `zktls` recipe exists precisely to prove a fact without revealing the underlying value, and copying that value into a cleartext public anchor would defeat the method. The exposure of `scheme`, `identifier`, and `decision` themselves is accepted by design per §12.1.

#### 7.5.1 Decision values and semantics

The four decision values are not interchangeable. Each has distinct semantics that govern retry behaviour, aggregation, and consumer interpretation:

- **pass** — verification ran cleanly and the authority confirmed the claim. The claim is verified.
- **fail** — verification ran cleanly and the authority’s response conclusively contradicts the claim (authority returned "no record found", returned a record that contradicts the asserted identifier, or returned an explicit denial). The claim is verified-false. fail is the authority’s decision; the verifier ran to completion.
- **indeterminate** — verification ran cleanly and the authority’s response was parseable but neither confirms nor contradicts the claim. Examples: authority returned a partial-match record; authority returned a status code that signals "result pending"; authority returned a record whose fields are insufficient to make the comparison the recipe requires. The authority gave its answer; the answer just wasn’t conclusive. indeterminate is the authority’s decision being non-binary.
- **error** — verification could not complete. Transport failure, SR-3 fetch timeout, malformed authority response that the parser cannot consume at all, parser exception, unexpected authority API change. The verifier never received a decision. error is the verifier’s failure to obtain an authority decision, not the authority’s decision to be ambiguous.

**Retry semantics.** (a) error MUST be handled per the recipe's retryClass (§7.6.1): the verifier MAY retry within the VP-R1 budget only when retryClass is `transient`; VP-R3 forbids in-session retry for `permanent`. (b) indeterminate MUST NOT be retried unless the recipe explicitly marks the method as retry-on-indeterminate (rare; reserved for authorities whose "pending" responses become conclusive on re-fetch). The authority’s indeterminate answer is the answer; re-asking does not change it. (c) pass and fail are terminal; no retry.

**Aggregation semantics.** A required claim with overall result error or indeterminate after retry budget exhaustion MUST cause vet-credentials to fail the phase. Consumers MUST NOT treat any of indeterminate, error, or fail as pass under any circumstances. Aggregation logic (§7.7.1) distinguishes the three non-pass outcomes in its failure reasons so downstream consumers (dispute, audit, debugging) can determine whether verification reached the authority at all.

**Why distinguish indeterminate from error.** Both produce non-pass outcomes, but the diagnostic value differs significantly. error means "we should try again or change verification path." indeterminate means "the authority answered, and the answer is not yes or no — escalate to a different authority or accept the ambiguity." Collapsing them loses information that consumers need.

#### 7.5.2 Attestation resolution algorithm

A consumer of a VerifyResult MUST validate the attestation by:

1. fetching the anchor at AttestationRef.anchor.locator;
2. checking integrity against AttestationRef.contentHash by the same procedure that produced it at anchor time (contentHash is the sha256 of the anchored content's canonical form, per the Content-hash definition):
   - for attestations that are canonical-JSON DACS documents — parsing the fetched content, recomputing the RFC 8785 canonical form, and comparing sha256(canonical_form) to AttestationRef.contentHash;
   - for raw-byte attestations (e.g. a consensus-backed-proxy response body per §7.3.5, a tlsnotary proof, or an oauth-attested envelope) — hashing the fetched bytes and comparing sha256(bytes) to AttestationRef.contentHash;
   - mismatch MUST cause rejection in either case;
3. for methods with signer, validating the attestation signature against the signer’s known key (mismatch MUST cause rejection);
4. optionally parsing the attestation to independently re-derive the structured data (for high-stakes verifications).

### 7.6 Verification procedure

The verifier MUST execute each claim verification by:

1. resolving the recipe and pinning recipeVersion to the session record;
2. rendering method inputs by substituting the claim’s identifier into the method’s template;
3. invoking the method (calling the appropriate substrate primitive for SR-3 methods, or external service);
4. receiving the attestation (raw bytes or a reference if too large for inline transport);
5. anchoring the attestation via SR-2 at the derived address;
6. parsing the response by applying recipe.parserRules to extract structured data into VerifyResult.data;
7. applying parameters — checking the listing’s ClaimRequirement.parameters against extracted data (failure to match MUST set decision = "fail");
8. signing and emitting the VerifyResult.

#### 7.6.1 Retry and caching semantics

**Retry policy.** The verifier retries only its own *transient* failures; an authority's substantive answer is final.

- (VP-R1) On `decision = "error"` with `recipe.retryClass == "transient"`, the verifier MAY retry up to a recipe-defined retry budget (default: 3 attempts, exponential backoff).
- (VP-R2) A retry MUST produce a new attestation; reusing the prior attestation is not a retry.
- (VP-R3) On `recipe.retryClass == "permanent"`, the verifier MUST NOT retry within the same session; the failure is final for that session.
- (VP-R4) On `decision = "indeterminate"`, the verifier MUST NOT retry unless `recipe.retryOnIndeterminate` is explicitly true (default false). The authority’s indeterminate answer is itself the answer; re-asking does not change it. The `retryOnIndeterminate` flag is reserved for authorities whose "pending" or "queued" responses become conclusive on re-fetch.
**Reuse / caching.** (VP-C1) A VerifyResult for `(scheme, identifier, recipeVersion)` MAY be reused while it is still fresh:

    now ≤ VerifyResult.validUntil ?? (verifiedAt + defaultMaxAgeSec × 1000)

`validUntil` governs when present; `defaultMaxAgeSec` (read from the recipe at *that* `recipeVersion`) is the fallback only when `validUntil` is absent. This is the SAME `validUntil ?? default` window the §6.3.2 freshness gate uses (the `min` with `BundleClaim.expiresAt` in §6.3.2 is the bundle-presentation clamp, which has no analogue at reuse time), so the reuse and freshness rules agree.

- (VP-C2) Reuse MUST update the consuming session’s record to reference the cached VerifyResult.
- (VP-C3) Reuse MUST NOT bypass freshness requirements declared by the listing’s `ClaimRequirement.maxAge` (the listing can demand fresher than the cache window).

### 7.7 Composite verification record

The document the vet-credentials phase produces.

```
type CompositeVerificationRecord = {
  recordVersion: "1"
  jobId: string                               // DACS-5 session id
  evaluatedParty: ClaimReference              // counterparty's primary identity claim
  bundleHash: string                          // sha256 of the IdentityBundle this Vet ran against
  requirementHash: string                     // sha256 of the listing's BundleRequirement
  freshness: VerifyResultRef[]                // re-verifications of pre-attested claims
  supplementary: SupplementarySignal[]
  dealSpecific: VerifyResultRef[]
  overallDecision: "pass" | "fail" | "indeterminate" | "error"
  warnings?: VerificationWarning[]            // advisory only; MUST NOT affect overallDecision (WN-1)
  generatedAt: number
  signature: ComponentSignature               // signed by the verifier
}
type VerifyResultRef = {
  anchor: { kind: "storage-program" | "ipfs" | "https"; locator: string }
  contentHash: string
  recipeVersion: number
}
type SupplementarySignal = {
  source: "dacs-5" | "cci-nomis" | "cci-ethos" | "cci-humanpassport" | "external" | string
  signalType: string                          // e.g. "completion-rate", "dispute-rate", "rating-avg"
  value: number | string
  observedAt: number
  attestation?: AttestationRef                // required for "external" sources
}
type VerificationWarning = {
  claimRef: ClaimReference                     // the claim (canonical scheme+identifier) that produced the warning
  code: WarningCode                            // enumerated; see below
  retryable: boolean                           // whether the condition is expected to be transient
  suggestedRetryAfterMs?: number               // advisory per-authority hint; does NOT override recipe-level backoff/retryBudget (WN-4)
}
type WarningCode =
  | "AUTHORITY_UNAVAILABLE"                     // 5xx, timeout, connection failure (maps to a VP-R1 transient error)
  | "AUTHORITY_RATE_LIMITED"                    // 429 or equivalent (VP-R1 transient)
  | "DNS_RESOLUTION_FAILED"                     // transient DNS failure (VP-R1 transient)
  | "TLS_HANDSHAKE_FAILED"                      // transient TLS/certificate issue (VP-R1 transient)
  | "RESPONSE_MALFORMED"                        // unexpected response format (VP-R1 transient, or permanent per recipe retryClass)
  | "RETRY_EXHAUSTED"                           // all VP-R1 retry attempts spent (terminal)
```

**Verification warnings (rules WN-1..WN-6).** The optional `warnings` array surfaces transient/retryable verification conditions encountered while producing the record — without changing the verification decision. Warnings are strictly advisory and orthogonal to the §7.7.1 aggregation:

- (WN-1) the presence of one or more warnings MUST NOT change `overallDecision`;
- (WN-2) warnings MUST NOT be used to convert a `pass` into a `fail` or vice versa;
- (WN-3) warnings MUST be preserved in the record even when `overallDecision` is `pass` (they document conditions a consumer may act on operationally, e.g. an authority that was rate-limited but answered on retry);
- (WN-4) `suggestedRetryAfterMs` is an advisory per-authority hint and does NOT override the recipe-level `backoff` (§7.4.1) or `retryBudget` (§7.6.1 VP-R1) — the recipe remains the governing retry policy and the warning only adds per-authority context;
- (WN-5) consumers SHOULD surface warnings to human operators when `overallDecision` is `indeterminate` (the warnings often explain *why* the answer was inconclusive);
- (WN-6) implementations MAY add implementation-specific `code` values but SHOULD prefer the enumerated v0.1 codes when applicable, and a consumer encountering an unknown code MUST treat it conservatively (as advisory, never as grounds to elevate or downgrade the decision — consistent with WN-1/WN-2).

The codes align with the §7.6.1 retry taxonomy: the five transient codes correspond to a VP-R1 retryable `error`, and `RETRY_EXHAUSTED` records that the VP-R1 budget was spent.

CCI-native reputation signals (cci-nomis, cci-ethos, cci-humanpassport) are first-class supplementary signal sources: they are read from the counterparty’s CCI without needing a separate attestation, because the underlying CCI context’s GCR routine has already validated them.

#### 7.7.1 Aggregation algorithm

A verifier MUST compute overallDecision per the following algorithm. The algorithm distinguishes four cases for each required claim: passing, indeterminate (authority answered ambiguously), errored (verifier could not reach the authority), and failing/absent. Precedence among non-pass outcomes is failures > errors > indeterminates so that the strongest evidence dominates aggregation.

```
aggregate(record, requirement):

  failures := []

  errors := []

  indeterminates := []

  # All required claims must have a passing VerifyResult

  for cr in requirement.required:

    classify_required(record, cr, failures, errors, indeterminates)

  # oneOf groups must each contain at least one passing

  for group in requirement.oneOf:

    if not any(find_passing(record, cr.scheme) for cr in group):

      # A oneOf group is satisfied iff ≥1 member passes (OR within the group).
      # When none pass, classify the group by whether it could STILL be satisfied.
      # Precedence WITHIN a oneOf group is error > indeterminate > fail — deliberately
      # the OPPOSITE of the required-claim/global precedence (fail > error > indeterminate):
      # in an OR group a retryable error or a pending indeterminate alternative means the
      # group is NOT yet conclusively unsatisfiable, so it MUST NOT be reported as a hard
      # fail (which would terminate a vet a retry could still satisfy). Only when every
      # member hard-fails is the group a conclusive fail.

      if any(find_error(record, cr.scheme) for cr in group):

        errors.append("oneOf group: at least one claim errored")

      else if any(find_indeterminate(record, cr.scheme) for cr in group):

        indeterminates.append("oneOf group: at least one claim indeterminate")

      else:

        failures.append("oneOf group: no claim satisfied")

  # Cross-accumulator precedence (across ALL required claims and oneOf groups): failures > errors > indeterminates.
  # This is fail-first because a single hard-failed REQUIRED claim dooms the whole requirement (AND), regardless of
  # any retryable oneOf group. (It is distinct from the within-a-oneOf-group precedence above, which is error-first.)

  if failures: return "fail", failures

  if errors: return "error", errors

  if indeterminates: return "indeterminate", indeterminates

  return "pass", []

classify_required(record, cr, failures, errors, indeterminates):

  results := find_all_results(record, cr.scheme)   // freshness ++ dealSpecific (supplementary signals NOT included); find_passing/find_error/find_indeterminate(record, scheme) each scan find_all_results(record, scheme) for a result with the named decision

  if results is empty:

    failures.append("required not present: " + cr.scheme)

    return

  if any(r.decision == "pass" for r in results):

    return  // claim satisfied

  if any(r.decision == "fail" for r in results):

    failures.append("required failing: " + cr.scheme)

    return

  if any(r.decision == "error" for r in results):

    errors.append("required errored: " + cr.scheme)

    return

  // remaining results are "indeterminate"

  indeterminates.append("required indeterminate: " + cr.scheme)
```

Supplementary signals MUST NOT change overallDecision from pass to fail automatically; they are informational. A listing MAY declare in terms that specific signals are gating (e.g. minimum reputation score); when so declared, the gating check is treated as a deal-specific claim and runs through the same aggregation. The four classifications carry distinct diagnostic value: "required not present" (no VerifyResult at all), "required failing" (authority said no), "required indeterminate" (authority answered ambiguously), "required errored" (verifier could not reach authority). Consumers debugging or auditing a failed session can read the failure reasons to determine which class the failure belongs to.

#### 7.7.2 Anchoring and signature

- **Anchor.** The composite record MUST be anchored via SR-2 at address `dacs2:composite:{jobId}:{evaluatedParty}` (or substrate equivalent). `{evaluatedParty}` is a ClaimReference and a CF-4 variable segment, so it MUST be percent-encoded before assembly (CORE §B.1).
- **Record.** The anchor reference is recorded in the DACS-5 session record.
- **Sign.** The composite record’s signature MUST be produced by the verifier (the party running Vet on the counterparty) over the domain-separated payload per §B.7:

signed_bytes := "dacs-composite:v1:" || composite_hash
In v0.1, the composite record carries a single verifier signature. Multi-party composition (e.g., two-sided independent Vet records cross-referenced into one) is deferred to v2.

### 7.8 The vet-credentials phase

```
type VetCredentialsInput = {
  jobId: string
  actor: "buyer" | "seller"
  bundleToVet: IdentityBundle
  requirement: BundleRequirement
  verifierIdentity: IdentityBundle
  sessionContext: SessionContext
  recipeRegistryVersion: number
  attempt: number
}
type VetCredentialsOutput = PhaseHandlerResult & {
  contextDelta: {
    "vet-credentials": {
      compositeRecord: AttestationRef
      overallDecision: "pass" | "fail" | "indeterminate" | "error"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 7.8.1 Phase contract

The orchestrator MUST:

- (VPC-1) invoke vet-credentials after a successful Identify stage and before any Negotiate phase requiring a verified bundle;
- (VPC-2) invoke vet-credentials **once per party** — each party's bundle is vetted against the *counterparty's* requirements:
  - the buyer’s bundle against listing-side requirements on buyers, and
  - the seller’s bundle against buyer-side requirements on sellers —

  each invocation producing its own CompositeVerificationRecord (the input carries a single `bundleToVet` + `actor`), before Negotiate;
- (VPC-3) anchor the composite record before returning the phase result;
- (VPC-4) on `overallDecision != "pass"` (after permitted retries), MUST fail the phase with `errorClass` derived from the overall decision:

  | overall decision | `errorClass` (fault attribution) |
  | --- | --- |
  | `fail` | counterparty |
  | `indeterminate` / `error` | permanent |
  | *except* an `error`/`indeterminate` whose sole proximate cause is a presentation the counterparty supplied that the verifier could not parse in its declared format | counterparty (§7.8.2) |

This affects fault attribution only; the overall decision is unchanged. By the point VPC-4 is evaluated the retry budget is already exhausted (`indeterminate` MUST NOT be retried at all per VP-R4; `error` is retried only while budget remains), so the *phase-overall* outcome is terminal: the `transient` class applies to in-flight retries, never to the phase-fail result. This matches the §7.8.2 cause table (`indeterminate`/`error` after retry-budget exhaustion → permanent).

#### 7.8.2 Error classification and idempotency

| Error class | Cause | Retry? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| transient | Substrate temporarily unavailable; authority HTTP 5xx | Yes (per VP-R1) |
| permanent | Bundle malformed/unparseable; or `indeterminate`/`error` after retry-budget exhaustion (per recipe.retryClass) | No |
| counterparty | Counterparty fails to present a required claim, OR a required claim returns `decision=fail` (the authority conclusively rejected the counterparty's claim) | No (Vet fails; counterparty marked at-fault) |
| substrate | SR-2 or SR-3 unavailable for sustained period | Pause session per DACS-5 |

**VPC-4 is the authoritative cause→class mapping; this table enumerates causes consistent with it, not an independent rule.**

- A required claim returning `decision=fail` maps to **counterparty** (per VPC-4: `"fail" → counterparty`) — it is the counterparty's claim that the authority rejected, so it is never `permanent`.
- `permanent` is reserved for self-caused or structural failures (a malformed/unparseable bundle on the verifier/local side) and for `indeterminate`/`error` outcomes that exhaust their retry budget for non-counterparty reasons.
- **However, when the error/indeterminate is solely caused by a presentation the COUNTERPARTY supplied that the verifier could not parse in its declared format — an observable provenance (counterparty-supplied bytes that fail to parse) — the class is `counterparty`, not `permanent`**: the counterparty malformed its own claim, mirroring `decision=fail → counterparty`. This notably covers a `oneOf` group classified `error`/`indeterminate` only because the counterparty malformed one alternative while another conclusively failed (a credential-less counterparty must not escape the counterparty fault by malforming an alternative).
- This carve-out affects **fault attribution only** — the overall decision and the within-a-oneOf-group decision precedence (error > indeterminate > fail, §7.7.1) are unchanged.
- Because the class is fully determined by the decision/cause, an orchestrator has no discretion to steer a self-caused `fail` away from the counterparty fault bucket, nor to steer a counterparty-malformed `error` into the self/`permanent` bucket (§10.5.1).

Re-running vet-credentials with the same inputs MUST produce the same composite-record content modulo the volatile fields refreshed against current state — `generatedAt`, each VerifyResult's `fetchedAt`/`verifiedAt`, and supplementary signals' `observedAt`/`value`. The orchestrator MUST NOT double-anchor; the reuse/no-change test is over the **stable** content (the freshness/deal-specific VerifyResultRefs + decisions, excluding those volatile timestamp/value fields), so an unchanged authority state reuses the existing anchor.

### 7.9 Conformance summary

| Role | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Method implementer | CM-1 through CM-5 |
| Recipe author | RA-1 through RA-5; PSP field semantics (§7.3.6) when declaring a ParserSpec |
| Recipe-availability consumer | RAV-1 through RAV-4 |
| Recipe steward (availability & governance) | RAV-5 through RAV-7; GOV-2; PA-1 through PA-3 |
| Verifier (orchestrator) | VP-R1 through VP-R4; VP-C1 through VP-C3; VPC-1 through VPC-4; PSP-1 through PSP-5; WN-1 through WN-4 |
| VerifyResult consumer | §7.5.2 attestation resolution; recipe-version pinning; WN-5, WN-6; GOV-3 |
| Composite record reader | §7.7.1 aggregation; signature validation |

### 7.10 Rationale

**Method-pluggable registry vs single method.** No single approach fits every credential (cooperative-issuer → W3C VC; private-data → zkTLS; public-registry → consensus-backed proxy). The registry routes by type; the stack consumes a uniform `VerifyResult`.

**Closed v0.1 method set vs open.** An open registry makes conformance untestable (a verifier could declare an arbitrary method producing unvalidatable results). v0.1 ships eight methods covering the established attestation patterns; new ones come via the steward's acceptance process, as in DACS-1.

**Recipe-per-scheme vs general-purpose protocol.** A general-purpose fetch endpoint would lose the structured parser rules, success-criterion semantics, and negative-match pattern recipes encode. Recipes are small, per-scheme, and capture each authority's messy response format.

**Composite record vs per-claim records.** The stack references *one* Vet artifact, not N. The composite record composes, signs, and anchors once instead of forcing every consumer to walk a list.

**SR-3 dependency for consensus-backed-proxy.** Substrate-agnostic alternatives (single proxy / MPC TLSNotary) exist as separate registry methods but cost more per verification. For high-volume public-registry verification — the bulk of institutional Vet — consensus-backed proxy at chain rate is the right tool; the dependency is explicit and opt-in per recipe.

**Single-verifier signature on the composite record.** Each side runs Vet on the other and produces its own record; v0.1 carries one signature per record. Mutual-Vet multi-party composition is deferred.

**Reputation as supplementary signal, not a hard gate.** Reputation has no authoritative source; as a hard gate it would lock new sellers out of the market. It is surfaced to the verifier (and optional listing gating) but does not by default block engagement.

### 7.11 Backwards compatibility

**W3C Verifiable Credentials.** A recipe MAY declare `verifiable-credential` as its method; the verifier accepts a W3C VP per VC data model 2.0. Recipe authors SHOULD set `issuerAllowList` where only specific issuers are trusted (e.g. a `kyc-tier` recipe allow-listing specific KYC providers).

**TLSNotary.** A recipe MAY declare `tlsnotary`; the notary signature anchors as part of `AttestationRef`. Compatible with the PSE 2024 rebuild and later.

**zkTLS / Reclaim / Pluto.** A recipe MAY declare `zktls` and select a provider whose circuit / verification-program id determines the check. Compatible with Reclaim's production verifier contracts and equivalent providers shipping a circuit description.

**ERC-8004.** `erc8004`-scheme recipes use `evm-rpc` to read token ownership via proxy-attested call. DACS-2 results MAY additionally be published to ERC-8004 reputation/validation registries via DACS-5; DACS-2 itself does not write there.

**ACME / Let's Encrypt.** The `domain-tls-control` method follows ACME's challenge/response (RFC 8555); implementations MAY reuse existing ACME libraries.

### 7.12 Security considerations

**Method substitution.** *Threat:* a verifier uses a weaker method than the recipe declares. *Mitigation:* the VerifyResult.method field MUST be the method actually executed; consumers compare to the recipe’s defaultMethod and alternatives and reject results that used an unaccepted method. Recipes SHOULD list only equivalent alternatives.

**Recipe poisoning.** *Threat:* a compromised recipe registry returns incorrect parsing rules, causing every verification using that recipe to mis-classify outcomes. *Mitigation:* recipes are signed by the registry steward (currently KyneSys Labs, per §7.4.4); consumers MUST verify the signature. Recipe recipeVersion is monotonic and pinned per session; an attacker compromising the registry tomorrow does not retroactively change recipes used in already-pinned sessions. Steward-key compromise is the principal residual risk under the current PA-2 single-signer phase; multi-signature governance (PA-3) is the v0.2+ mitigation pathway.

**Replay of VerifyResult across sessions.** *Threat:* a verifier reuses a stale VerifyResult from a different session or a different counterparty. *Mitigation:* the VerifyResult.identifier MUST match the claim under verification canonically; consumers verify the match. The composite record’s bundleHash and evaluatedParty bind the verification to a specific bundle. Cross-session reuse within validUntil is explicitly permitted and is safe because the result still verifies against the same identifier.

**TOCTOU: authority state changes between fetch and use.** *Threat:* a counterparty’s authority status changes between Vet and the actual transaction execution. *Mitigation:* listings handling time-sensitive flows SHOULD set ClaimRequirement.maxAge aggressively (e.g., 60 seconds for OFAC clearance on a real-money trade). Sessions with long latency between Vet and Settle SHOULD re-run Vet at Settle time for the most stake-sensitive claims.

**Substrate validator capture (SR-3).** *Threat:* a majority-corrupt substrate validator set forges responses, causing consensus-backed-proxy and evm-rpc methods to attest to false facts. *Mitigation:* the substrate’s consensus model is the trust floor; DACS-2 inherits whatever security properties the substrate provides. For credentials where this risk is unacceptable, recipes SHOULD declare **alternative independent methods** (the recipe `alternatives` mechanism, §7.4) so a high-stakes claim can additionally be verified by an independent method (e.g. tlsnotary or zktls) rather than relying on consensus-backed-proxy alone. Note the scope of what v0.1 composes: **cross-claim AND** — a listing requiring several distinct verified claims, all of which MUST pass — is already enforced (§6.3.3 `BundleRequirement.required`, "all MUST be satisfied"), and is how a real vet stacks GLEIF + OFAC + reputation. What v0.1 does **not** define is a single-claim multi-method-**AND** combinator (verifying the *same* claim by two methods that MUST both pass): §7.7.1 aggregation composes multiple VerifyResults for one claim but has no `requireAll` semantics, and no such flag is defined on the Recipe. Single-claim multi-method-AND is a roadmap item; v0.1 high-stakes recipes use alternatives (additional independent methods) plus cross-claim required-set AND.

**W3C VC issuer compromise.** *Threat:* the signing key of a VC issuer is compromised, causing all VCs signed by that issuer to be untrustworthy. *Mitigation:* recipes SHOULD set issuerAllowList and check issuer revocation registries (where available, e.g., W3C VC Status List 2021). Issuers SHOULD rotate keys regularly. Consumers of historical VerifyResults SHOULD check whether the issuer was known-compromised at the time of verification.

**TLSNotary notary collusion.** *Threat:* the notary colludes with the prover to attest to false TLS sessions. *Mitigation:* TLSNotary’s MPC ensures the notary cannot see plaintext but does require honesty about the commitment. Recipes using tlsnotary SHOULD specify a known-good notary public key in the recipe; multi-notary patterns are a future extension.

**zkTLS proxy compromise.** *Threat:* the zkTLS provider’s proxy attests to false TLS responses. *Mitigation:* recipes select specific providers and program IDs. Compromise of a provider’s proxy invalidates all results from that provider; consumers SHOULD treat results from a known-compromised provider as invalid retroactively.

**Supplementary signal poisoning.** *Threat:* false reputation data is injected (e.g. a Sybil network creating fake successful completions). *Mitigation:* DACS-5 specifies the reputation derivation; supplementary signals from DACS-5 inherit DACS-5’s anti-Sybil properties. Supplementary signals from external sources MUST carry an AttestationRef; consumers MAY decline to weigh signals from sources they do not trust.

**Identifier canonicalisation gaps.** *Threat:* the same logical identifier in two different forms produces two different VerifyResult lookups or two different reputation keys, allowing an attacker to substitute or to split/launder reputation. *Mitigation:* the canonical-form rules CF-1 (NFC, §B.2), CF-2 (ClaimReference canonical byte form), and CF-3 (canonical identity = canonical scheme + identifier, parameters excluded), plus any per-scheme identifier rule, are normative. Verifiers MUST canonicalise per CF-1/CF-2 before issuing a VerifyResult, and consumers MUST compare per the CF-3 identity before lookup, reputation keying, or the §7.3.2 replay check.

**Composite record forgery.** *Threat:* an attacker constructs a composite record with overallDecision = "pass" and false VerifyResultRefs. *Mitigation:* the composite record is signed by the verifier; consumers verify the signature. The bundleHash and requirementHash fields bind the record to specific inputs; consumers verify these against the inputs they actually used. Each VerifyResultRef MUST be dereferenced and content-hash-validated before the composite record is accepted.

**Indeterminate-decision exploitation.** *Threat:* an attacker arranges for a required claim’s verification to fail in a way that returns indeterminate rather than fail, hoping consumers treat the result as pass. *Mitigation:* indeterminate is not pass. The aggregation algorithm treats indeterminate in a required position as overall indeterminate, which MUST fail the phase.
