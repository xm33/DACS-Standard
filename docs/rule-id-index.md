# Rule-ID index

This non-normative index helps implementers locate labelled conformance rules in the specification. The specification text remains authoritative.

| VPC-* | Vet phase contract | [§7.8](../spec/SPECIFICATION.md#78-the-vet-credentials-phase) | [§14.2](../spec/SPECIFICATION.md#142-dacs-2-vet) |
| PC-* | Payment phase common contract | [§9.5](../spec/SPECIFICATION.md#95-payment-phases) | [§14.4](../spec/SPECIFICATION.md#144-dacs-4-settle) |

## How to use this index

- Treat it as a navigation aid only; rule wording lives in the linked spec sections.
- Prefer rule-family tests that point at the §14 conformance plan before adding one-off checks.
- Substrate-capability checks are indexed separately in [§14.8](../spec/SPECIFICATION.md#148-substrate-capability-tests).
- Update this index when a new labelled rule family is added to the specification.
