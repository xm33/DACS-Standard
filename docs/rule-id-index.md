# Rule-ID index

This non-normative index helps implementers locate labelled conformance rules in the specification. The specification text remains authoritative.

## How to use this index

- Treat it as a navigation aid only; rule wording lives in the linked spec sections.
- Prefer rule-family tests that point at the §14 conformance plan before adding one-off checks.
- Substrate-capability checks are indexed separately in [§14.8](../spec/CONFORMANCE-PLAN.md#148-substrate-capability-tests).
- Update this index when a new labelled rule family is added to the specification.
- Run `python3 scripts/validate_rule_ids.py` before opening a PR that edits labelled rules or this index.
